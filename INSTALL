To install, issue a

   # python setup.py install

command, as root.

-------------------------------------------------

To use, launch your python interpreter:

   $ python

and load the dvdauthor module:

   >>> import dvdauthor

and start exploring the documentation. Everything is
self-documented, so a:

   >>> help(dvdauthor)

should give you a nice overview of the functions.
