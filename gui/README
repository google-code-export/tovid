tovid GUI 0.19
A GUI frontend for tovid

Project homepage: http://tovid.sourceforge.net/
=====================================================

See INSTALL for installation instructions.


Version 0.19 is the second official release of the tovid
GUI. Many problems have been identifiedi and fixed, but
please keep in mind that tovid is still in its ALPHA phase
of development. It should not be used for mission-critical
applications; numerous bugs, quirks, and syntax errors
undoubtedly remain.

Full documentation for the tovid suite is maintained on the
project homepage:

CONTRIBUTIONS
=====================================================


Any contributions to this software (either in the form of improved
code and documentation, or in the form of money) will be gladly
accepted. To contribute, visit the tovid sourceforge project site:

=====================================================
BUG REPORTS AND FEATURE REQUESTS
=====================================================


tovid undoubtedly has bugs. If you find any of them, please
help us out by reporting them. The preferred method of bug
reporting is the sourceforge.net bug tracker; go to the tovid
sourceforge homepage:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/tovid/

About halfway down the screen, under "Tracker", select "Bugs".
Before you submit a bug, please check the list of existing
bugs to see if it has already been reported. (Use "Status: Any"
to view all bugs, open and closed; your bug may already be
known, and fixed!) You do not need a sourceforge account to
submit bugs, but if you do submit one, you may want to check
back once in a while to see its status.

If you have feature requests, you can use the sourceforge.net
Feature Request tracking system. Again, please check the list of
existing requests before submitting a new one. If your request
has already been requested by someone else, feel free to add your
vote as well! The more people request something, the more likely
it is to be implemented.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
=====================================================

Tovid was created and written by Eric Pierce. The 'dvrequant'
component was created by Jean-Francois Ouellette. The 'makexml'
features for interval chapter breaks, titlesets, and video grouping
were implemented by Rainer Unseld. The 'tovid' and 'postproc'
-parallel features were added by alecm.

Thanks to the authors of mplayer, mjpegtools, ffmpeg, vcdimager,
dvdauthor, ImageMagick, SoX, transcode, and normalize, which
tovid depends upon for most of its capabilities. Thanks to
LinuxQuestions.org for hosting a forum for discussion.

Special thanks to Khurram Ahmed, Thomas Lie, Jean-Francois
Ouellette, Rainer Unseld, and everyone else who has helped to
test tovid, report bugs, and suggest improvements.

Thanks, finally, to everyone who just emailed me to say
they like tovid and think it's great. Amid the day-to-day
maintenance and bug reports, it's always nice to be
reminded that people are using tovid and like it. Even if
you haven't emailed, I know there are at least 35 subscribers
to tovid on freshmeat.net, with more joining all the time.
All of you are probably keeping an eye on new releases and using
the program, which makes me happy.

Unlike proprietary software, users really drive the development
of open-source software. You, the users, are the ones who
help craft the software you use. I've really enjoyed all the
user participation that tovid has had; your interest has pushed
development far beyond what would have occurred otherwise; tovid
could never have grown so much and so quickly without you. I'm
looking forward to making it even better, with your help.

Let's show them a Linux video disc authoring tool that blows the
proprietary software away! And let's build it through the strength
of the Linux community - communication.

CHANGELOG
