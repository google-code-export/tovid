postproc: Re\-sync or requantize an MPEG file

.SS Description
.P
postproc is designed to do simple post\-processing on MPEG video files, such
as those generated by tovid. It can adjust audio/video sync, and requantize
(shrink) without re\-encoding.

.SS Usage
.P
\fBpostproc\fR [ \fIOPTIONS\fR ] \fIIN_FILE\fR \fIOUT_FILE\fR

.SS Options
.TP
\fB\-audiodelay\fR \fINUM\fR
Delay the audio stream by \fINUM\fR milliseconds. Use this if
your final output has audio that is not synced with the
video. For example, if the audio comes 2 seconds sooner than
the video, use "\-audiodelay 2000". Use a negative number for
audio that comes later than the video.

.TP
\fB\-shrink\fR \fINUM\fR
Shrink the video stream by a factor of \fINUM\fR. May be a decimal
value. A value of 1.0 means the video will be the same size;
larger values cause more reduction in size. Beyond 2.0, the
returns are diminishing.

.TP
\fB\-parallel\fR
Run all processes in parallel and pipe into multiplexer should
increase speed significantly.

.TP
\fB\-debug\fR
Save output in a temporary file, for later viewing if
something goes wrong.
