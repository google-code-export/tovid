postproc: Re\-sync or requantize an MPEG file

.SS Description
.P
postproc is designed to do simple post\-processing on MPEG video files, such
as those generated by tovid. It can adjust audio/video sync, and requantize
(shrink) without re\-encoding.

.SS Usage
.nf
  postproc [OPTIONS] IN_FILE OUT_FILE
.fi


.SS Options
.TP
\-audiodelay [NUM]
Delay the audio stream by [NUM] milliseconds. Use this if
your final output has audio that is not synced with the
video. For example, if the audio comes 2 seconds sooner than
the video, use "\-audiodelay 2000". Use a negative number for
audio that comes later than the video.
.TP
\-shrink [NUM]
Shrink the video stream by a factor of [NUM]. May be a decimal
value. A value of 1.0 means the video will be the same size;
larger values cause more reduction in size. Beyond 2.0, the
returns are diminishing.
.TP
\-parallel
Run all processes in parallel and pipe into multiplexer should
increase speed significantly.
.TP
\-debug
Save output in a temporary file, for later viewing if
something goes wrong.
