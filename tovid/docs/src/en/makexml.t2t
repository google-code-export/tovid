makexml manual


==Name==

makexml: Generate a video disc structure XML description


==Description==

makexml generates XML output describing an (S)VCD
or DVD file structure and navigation hierarchy in the format expected by
[dvdauthor http://dvdauthor.sourceforge.net/] or
[vcdxbuild http://www.vcdimager.org/].


==Usage==

**makexml** [//OPTIONS//] //VIDEOS// -out //OUTFILE//

For example:

```
$ makexml -menu MainMenu.mpg \
    Season1.mpg Season2.mpg Featurettes.mpg \
    -out MyDisc
```


==Options==

: **-dvd** (default)
    Generate the XML for a DVD disc, to be used with dvdauthor or makedvd.
: **-vcd**
    Generate the XML for a VCD disc, to be used with vcdxbuild or makevcd.
: **-svcd**
    Generate the XML for an SVCD disc, to be used with vcdxbuild or makevcd.
: **-overwrite**
    Overwrite any existing output files.


//VIDEOS// may be any of the following:

: //<file list>//
    List of one or more video files to include, separated by spaces. At
    minimum, a DVD must have one video file. You can use shell wildcards
    (i.e., "*.mpg") to include multiple files easily. Put filenames in
    quotes if they have spaces in them.

: **-menu** //VIDEO// //<file list>//
    Use video file //VIDEO// as a menu from which you can jump to each of
    the listed video files. If you have multiple menus, include a
    top menu so they are reachable.

: **-slides** //<file list>//
    Create a slide-show of still images


DVD-only options

: **-group** //<file list>// **-endgroup**
    (DVD only) List of video files to include as one single title. This is useful
    if you have split a movie into several video files.

: **-topmenu** //VIDEO// [**-menu** //VIDEO// //<file list>//] [**-menu** //VIDEO// //<file list>//]...
    (DVD only) Use video file //VIDEO// for the top-level (VMGM) menu. The 
    top menu will jump to each of the subsequent [-menu...] videos listed. 
    Use this only if you have multiple sub-menus to jump to. You can only 
    have one top menu.

: **-titlesets**
    (DVD only) Forces the creation of a separate titleset per title. This
    is useful if the titles of a DVD have different video formats,
    e.g. PAL + NTSC or 4:3 + 16:9. If used with menus, there must be a
    **-topmenu** option that specifies a menu file with an entry for each of the
    titlesets.

: **-chapters** //INTERVAL//
    (DVD only) Creates a chapter every //INTERVAL// minutes (default 5 minutes:
    without **-chapters**, each movie will be divided into 5-minute chapters). 
    This option can be put at any position in a //<file list>// and is valid 
    for all subsequent titles until a new **-chapters** option is encountered. 
    Using this option may take some time, since the duration of the video is 
    calculated.

: **-nochapters**
    (DVD only) Don't create chapters for the videos.


//OUT_PREFIX// is the file that will receive the resulting XML.


==Usage notes==

makexml checks to make sure the video filenames you
give it exist, but it does not check whether they are valid for the
chosen disc format. MPEG videos of menus should have the specified
number of buttons for reaching each of the videos, and, if you're
using DVD, should be multiplexed with their corresponding subtitles
using spumux of the dvdauthor 0.6.0 package prior to
authoring using dvdauthor. If you use the [makemenu makemenu.html]
component to generate the menu, this should all be handled for you.


==Examples==

: ``makexml -dvd title-1.mpg title-2.mpg title-3.mpg -out My_DVD``
    Make a DVD without a menu. Title 1, 2, and 3 will play in sequence.

: ``makexml -dvd -group chapter-1.mpg chapter-2.mpg chapter-3.mpg -end-group -out My_DVD``
    Group the file chapter-1|2|3.mpg into one title and make a DVD without a menu.

: ``makexml -dvd -menu main_menu.mpg -chapters 3 movie-1.mpg -chapters 10 movie-2.mpg -out My_DVD``
    Make a DVD with a main menu that points to two movies, with movie-1.mpg
divided into 3-minute chapters, and movie-2.mpg into 10-minute chapters.
