tovid plans


What's still needed

- Good system for translating documentation (and applications)
- Fewer dependencies!
- Automation script(s) for batch-converting and auto-generating
    menus/disc structure for a given dir hierarchy containing videos
- Working save/load in the GUI (requires some kind of merge of the
    GUI and pytovid codebases)
- Nicer default menu backgrounds, as suggested by corpix (see IRC log)
