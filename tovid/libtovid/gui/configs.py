        # IM and wx store their available fonts differently, so we need a 
        # dictionary that maps the wx name for a font to its IM name. For 
        # example: "Bitstream Vera Sans Mono" in wx maps to 
        # "Bitstream-Vera-Sans-Mono" in IM. Fortunately, the difference 
        # between font names are only non-word characters. So by abbreviating
        # the names of each font, common fonts can be found in the
        # intersection of the two sets of abbreviated names. If the
        # abbreviated names are keys in a dictionary that map the abbreviated
        # name to the original name, then the shared keys between the IM and 
        # wx dictionaries can be used to build the final wx <--> IM dictionary.
        # phew!

        # Process outline:
        # 1. Find the fonts of IM and wx
        # 2. Abbreviate the names by removing spaces, underscores, and dashes
        # 3. Use dicts to map the abbreviated name (key) to the original name 
        #    (value)
        # 4. Find the common keys between both dicts (and thus the common 
        #    fonts)
        # 5. Build the wx <--> dict using the common keys

        # 1a. Find IM's fonts. IM's output is a mixture of font names and 
        #     paths. We only want the names of fonts, not the 'pretty' print 
        #     given by IM. However, since we're looking for _shared_ font 
        #     names, the 'bad' lines from IM can be left alone (as they will 
        #     be taken out later when looking for matching font names from 
        #     wx). wx is acting as our regex in a way ;) Each line that 
        #     describes a font also includes the foundry and other information
        #     we don't want. We only want the font_name, which is the 
        #     first word on each line.
