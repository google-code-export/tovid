# Notes and ideas for a unified theory of tovid


# ========================================
# Creating a disc by performing several steps
# ========================================

# This is the old tovid approach to authoring
# a disc, and normally entails running:
#
#       tovid       (to convert each video)
#       makemenu    (to create menus)
#       makexml     (to build a dvdauthor/vcdxbuild XML spec)
#       makedvd     (to author, create and burn a disc .ISO)
#
# Authoring a disc this way requires significant
# user intervention and maintenance; the user must
# keep track of what titles are listed on each menu,
# and what multimedia video files are associated
# with those titles. The user must also take pains
# to ensure that all video files are converted to
# a compliant format prior to authoring.
#
# However, this approach is already familiar to tovid's
# users, and I have no intentions of abandoning it.
# But I would like to extend and unify it somewhat,
# into something new...

# ========================================
# Creating a disc by writing a text file
# ========================================

# This approach would allow users to layout
# a video disc specification using a simple
# text language, resembling the command-line
# options already used by 'tovid' components.
#
# It would give the user complete control over
# all conversion and filtering, all menu design
# customizations, and all disc navigational
# characteristics. In short, it is a unified
# interface to all the functionality of the
# tovid suite.
#
# As such, it also serves as a tovid "project
# save file" format.
#
# ========================================

# EXAMPLE

# ---------------
# Disc definition
#
# Defines the highest-level attributes of a video
# disc (SVCD, VCD, DVD), including the disc name,
# overall standard format (if any), and the top-level
# navigational structure (menu or videos).
# ---------------
disc:
"Trailers"
    -dvd
    -ntsc
    -topmenu
        "Main Menu"

# ---------------
# Menu definitions
#
# Defines the characteristics of a menu, including
# the menu name, visual and audio attributes, and
# whether/how this menu links to other elements.
#
# Note: The -linksto attribute contains a list of
# (unique) names referring to other disc elements
# (menus, videos, slideshows).
# ---------------
menu:
"Main Menu"
    -linksto
        "Movie Trailers"
        "Game Trailers"
    -background mainmenu.jpg
    -font Hattenschweiler
    -textcolor #0099FF

menu:
"Movie Trailers"
    -linksto
        "Serenity"
        "Hitchhiker's Guide"
    -background movietrailersmenu.png
    -font "Courier New"

menu:
"Game Trailers"
    -linksto
        "MGS4"
        "FF7"
    -background gametrailersmenu.tif
    -font Verdana

# ---------------
# Video definitions
#
# Defines everything about a full-motion audio/video
# on the disc, including the input filename and any
# user-defined filters to be applied to the video
# prior to authoring.
# ---------------
video:
"Serenity"
    -in "Serenity.avi"
    -aspect 16:9
    -vbitrate 6000

video:
"Hitchhiker's Guide"
    -in "HHGG.mov"
    -aspect 16:9

video:
"MGS4"
    -in "MGS4.wmv"
    -aspect 4:3
    -interlaced

video:
"FF7"
    -in "FF7.mpg"
    -aspect 16:9

# Implementation notes
# ---------------

# Python standard library class 'shlex' for lexical analysis:
# http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-shlex.html
# Will definitely be useful in parsing!
