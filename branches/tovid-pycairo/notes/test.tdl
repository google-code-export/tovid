# This file is written in the tovid design language (TDL)
#
# ============================================
#
# TDL is a free-format language for describing
# attributes of video discs and their content.
#
# TDL allows you to design video discs by writing
# structured text using a syntax similar to that
# of the existing tovid tools 'tovid', 'makemenu'
# and 'makexml'.
#
# This file demonstrates how to write TDL, and
# contains an example disc project.


# ============================================
# Syntax
#
# Comments begin with a '#'; everything after a '#'
# on any line is ignored (unless it's in quotes).
#
# Keywords, arguments, and identifiers are all
# separated by whitespace (space, tab, or newline).
# The amount of whitespace is unimportant, so
# you can use it however you like to aid readability.
#
# Units of disc content are described by "elements".
# TDL elements include the Disc, Menu, and Video,
# for defining attributes about video discs,
# navigational menus, and multimedia video titles,
# respectively.
#
# In general, the TDL language follows this pattern:
#
#   Element "Name" [options]
#   Element "Name" [options]
#   ...
#
# This is an example definition of a Disc element:

Disc "Trailers"
    -format dvd
    -tvsys ntsc
    -topmenu
        "Main Menu"

# The first thing in a definition is the type of
# element you are defining ('Disc', in this case).
# The following string ("Trailers") is a unique name
# for this Disc element. Your name can have spaces
# in it, as long as there are quotation marks around it.
#
# After the element name is a list of "options" or
# "attributes". These are optionally preceded by a
# single '-'. Some of them accept arguments, as the
# '-topmenu' option above does. Again, anything
# containing spaces should be quoted.
#
# "Main Menu" above refers to the name of another
# element. Here is its definition:

Menu "Main Menu"
    -titles
        # Names of other elements, separated by commas
        "Movie Trailers",
        "Game Trailers"
    -background mainmenu.jpg
    -font Hattenschweiler
    -textcolor "#0099FF"

# This is a Menu element. It describes attributes
# of a navigational menu including background image,
# font face and color, and (most importantly) what
# other elements this menu links to. "Main Menu"
# links to two other elements, named "Movie Trailers"
# and "Game Trailers". Their definitions follow:

Menu "Movie Trailers"
    -titles
        "Serenity", "Hitchhiker's Guide"
    -background movietrailersmenu.png
    -font "Courier New"

Menu "Game Trailers"
    -titles
        "MGS4", "FF7"
    -background gametrailersmenu.tif
    -font Verdana

# Thus, we've created a menu hierarchy:
#
# "Main Menu":
#     "Movie Trailers"
#         "Serenity"
#         "Hitchhiker's Guide"
#     "Game Trailers"
#         "MGS4"
#         "FF7"
#
# Next, come the Video elements referenced
# above. Here's the simplest possible Video
# element definition:

Video "Serenity"
    -in "Serenity.avi"

# Here, we're defining only the filename of the
# video we want to use. Usually, this video will
# need to be converted to (S)VCD/DVD format, which
# tovid will handle automatically.
#
# There are a wealth of other options you can use
# for videos, though. You can put here any option
# that is accepted by the 'tovid' script. Here's
# an example:

Video "Hitchhiker's Guide"
    -in "HHGG.mov"
    -safe 95%       # Shrink the video to fit a 95% TV safe area
    -aspect 16:9    # Force the aspect ratio to be 16:9
    -interlaced     # Encode as an interlaced video
    -normalize      # Normalize the audio volume
    -quality 9      # Use high-quality video encoding (quality 1 - 10)

# Again, you can leave out the preceding '-' if
# you like. You may find this more readable:

Video "MGS4"
    in "MGS4.wmv"
    aspect 4:3
    interlaced
    abitrate 448

Video "FF7"
    in "FF7.mpg"
    aspect 16:9
    vbitrate 3000
    quality 5

# This concludes the TDL demo.
