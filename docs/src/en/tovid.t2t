==Name==

tovid: Convert video to (S)VCD/DVD format


==Description==

tovid converts arbitrary video files into (S)VCD/DVD-compliant
MPEG format, suitable for burning to CD/DVD-R for playback on a
standalone DVD player.


==Usage==

**tovid** [ //OPTIONS// ] **-in** //INFILE// **-out** //OUTPREFIX//


Where //INFILE// is any multimedia video file, and //OUTPREFIX// is what
you want to call the output file, minus the file extension. //OPTIONS//
are additional customizations, described below.

By default, you will (hopefully) end up with an NTSC DVD-compliant
MPEG-2 video file; if you burn this file to a DVD-R, it should be
playable on most DVD players.

For example:

: ``tovid -in foo.avi -out foo_encoded``
    Convert 'foo.avi' to NTSC DVD format, saving to 'foo_encoded.mpg'.

: ``tovid -pal -vcd foo.avi -out foo_encoded``
    Convert 'foo.avi' to PAL VCD format, saving to 'foo_encoded.mpg'.


==Basic options==

: **-v**, **-version**
    Print tovid version number only, then exit.
: **-quiet**
    Reduce output to the console.
: **-fake**
    Do not actually encode; only print the commands (mplayer, mpeg2enc etc.)
    that would be executed. Useful in debugging; have tovid give you the
    commands, and run them manually.
: **-debug**
    Print extra debugging information on standard output.
: **-refresh-deps**
    Regenerate the dependency list. tovid uses $HOME/.tovid/dependency.list to
    determine which of its dependencies are installed. If you install dependencies
    after tovid, use this option to make tovid aware of the newly installed ones.
: **-ffmpeg**
    Use ffmpeg for video encoding, instead of mplayer/mpeg2enc. Try this if
    you have any problems with the default encoding method. Using this option,
    encoding will be considerably faster. Works with **-vcd**, **-svcd**, and
    **-dvd**.



===Television standards===

: **-ntsc**
    NTSC format video (USA, Americas) (default)
: **-ntscfilm**
    NTSC-film format video
: **-pal**
    PAL format video (Europe and others)


===Formats===

Standard formats, should be playable in most DVD players:

: **-dvd**
    (720x480 NTSC, 720x576 PAL) DVD-compatible output (default)
: **-half-dvd**
    (352x480 NTSC, 352x576 PAL) Half-D1-compatible output
: **-svcd**
    (480x480 NTSC, 480x576 PAL) Super VideoCD-compatible output
: **-dvd-vcd**
    (352x240 NTSC, 352x288 PAL) VCD-on-DVD output
: **-vcd**
    (352x240 NTSC, 352x288 PAL) VideoCD-compatible output


Non-standard formats, playable in some DVD players:

: **-kvcd**
    (352x240 NTSC, 352x288 PAL) KVCD-enhanced long-playing video CD
: **-kdvd**
    (720x480 NTSC, 720x576 PAL) KVCD-enhanced long-playing DVD
: **-kvcdx3**
    (528x480 NTSC, 520x576 PAL) KVCDx3 specification
: **-kvcdx3a**
    (544x480 NTSC, 544x576 PAL) KVCDx3a specification (slightly wider)
: **-bdvd**
    (720x480 NTSC, 720x576 PAL) BVCD-enhanced long-playing DVD


See [kvcd.net http://kvcd.net/] for details on the KVCD specification. Please
note that KVCD ("K Video Compression Dynamics") is the name of a compression
scheme that can be applied to any MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 video, and has little to
do with VCD ("Video Compact Disc"), which is the name of a standard video disc
format.


==Advanced options==


===Aspect ratios===

tovid automatically determines aspect ratio of the input video by playing it in
mplayer. If your video plays with correct aspect in mplayer, you should not
need to override the default tovid behavior.

If mplayer does not play your video with correct aspect, you may provide an
explicit aspect ratio in one of several ways:

: **-full**
    Same as **-aspect 4:3**
: **-wide**
    Same as **-aspect 16:9**
: **-panavision**
    Same as **-aspect 235:100**
: **-aspect** //WIDTH//**:**//HEIGHT//
    Custom aspect, where //WIDTH// and //HEIGHT// are integers.


NOTE: This is the INPUT aspect ratio. tovid chooses an optimal output aspect
ratio for the selected disc format (VCD, DVD, etc.) and does the appropriate
letterboxing or anamorphic scaling.


===Video stream options===

: **-quality** //NUM//
    Desired output quality, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 giving the best
    quality at the expense of a larger output file. Output size can vary by
    approximately a factor of 4 (that is, -quality 1 output can be 25% the size
    of -quality 10 output). Your results may vary.

    At present, this option affects both output bitrate and quantization (but
    may, in the future, affect other quality/size-related attributes). Use
    -vbitrate if you want to explicitly provide a maximum bitrate.

: **-vbitrate** //NUM//
    Maximum bitrate to use for video (in kbits/sec). Must be within allowable
    limits for the given format. Overrides default values. Ignored for VCD,
    which must be constant bitrate.

: **-interlaced**
    Do interlaced encoding of the input video. Use this option if your video is
    interlaced, and you want to preserve as much picture quality as possible.
    Ignored for VCD, which doesn't support it.

    You can tell your source video is interlaced by playing it, and pausing
    during a scene with horizontal motion; if you see a "comb" effect at the
    edges of objects in the scene, you have interlaced video. Use this option
    to encode it properly. If you would prefer to have output in progressive
    format, use **-deinterlace**.

: **-deinterlace**, **-progressive**
    Convert interlaced source video into progressive output video. Because
    deinterlacing works by averaging fields together, some picture quality is
    invariably lost. Uses an adaptive kernel deinterlacer (kerndeint), or,
    if that's not available, the libavcodec deinterlacer (lavcdeint).

: **-mkvsub** //LANG// (EXPERIMENTAL)
    Attempt to encode an integrated subtitle stream (such as may be found in
    Matroska .mkv files) in the given language code (eng, jpn, etc.) May work
    for other formats.

: **-subtitles** //FILE//
    Get subtitles from //FILE// and encode them into the video.  WARNING: This
    hard-codes the subtitles into the video, and you cannot turn them off while
    viewing the video. By default, no subtitles are loaded. If your video is
    already compliant with the chosen output format, it will be re-encoded to
    include the subtitles.

: **-type** {live|animation|bw}
    Optimize video encoding for different kinds of video. Use 'live' (default)
    for live-action video, use 'animation' for cartoons or anime, and 'bw' for
    black-and-white video.  This option currently only has an effect with
    KVCD/KSVCD output formats; other formats may support this in the future.

: **-safe** //PERCENT//
    Fit the video within a safe area defined by //PERCENT//. For example,
    "-safe 90%" will scale the video to 90% of the width/height of the output
    resolution, and pad the edges with a black border. Use this if some of the
    picture is cut off when played on your TV.  The percent sign is optional.

: **-filters** {none,denoise,deblock,contrast,all} (default none)
    Apply post-processing filters to enhance the video. If your input video is
    very high quality, use 'none'. If your input video is grainy, use 'denoise';
    if it looks washed out or faded, use 'contrast'. You can use multiple 
    filters separated by commas. To apply all filters, use 'all'.

: **-fps** //RATIO//
    Force input video to be interpreted as //RATIO// frames per second.  May be
    necessary for some ASF, MOV, or other videos. //RATIO// should be an
    integer ratio such as "24000:1001" (23.976fps), "30000:1001" (29.97fps), or
    "25:1" (25fps). This option is temporary, and may disappear in future
    releases. (Hint: To convert a decimal like 23.976 to an integer ratio, just
    multiply by 1000, i.e. 23976:1000)


===Audio stream options===

: **-normalize**
    Analyze the audio stream and then normalize the volume of the audio.
    This is useful if the audio is too quiet or too loud, or you want to
    make volume consistent for a bunch of videos. Similar to running
    normalize without any parameters. The default is -12dB average level
    with 0dB gain.

: **-amplitude** //NUM//[dB]
    In addition to analyzing and normalizing, apply the gain to the audio
    such that the 'average' (RMS) sound level is //NUM//. Valid values
    range 0.0 - 1.0, with 0.0 being silent and 1.0 being full scale. Use
    //NUM//dB for a decibel gain below full scale (the default without
    -amplitude is -12dB).

: **-abitrate** //NUM//
    Encode audio at //NUM// kilobits per second.  Reasonable values include
    128, 224, and 384. The default is 224 kbits/sec, good enough for most
    encodings. The value must be within the allowable range for the chosen disc
    format; Ignored for VCD, which must be 224.


===Other options===

: **-config** //FILE//
    Read configuration from //FILE//, containing 'tovid' alone on the first
    line, and free-formatted (whitespace-separated) tovid command-line options
    on remaining lines.

: **-force**
    Force encoding of already-compliant video or audio streams.

: **-overwrite**
    Overwrite any existing output files (with the same name as the given
    **-out** option).

: **-priority** {low|medium|high}
    Sets the main encoding process to the given priority. With high priority,
    it may take other programs longer to load and respond. With lower priority,
    other programs will be more responsive, but encoding may take 30-40%
    longer.  The default is high priority.

: **-discsize** //NUM//
    Sets the desired target DVD/CD-R size to //NUM// mebibytes (2^20).  Default
    is 700 for CD, 4300 for DVD. Use higher values at your own risk. Use 650 or
    lower if you plan to burn to smaller-capacity CDs.

: **-parallel**
    Will perform encode/rip processes in parallel using named pipes. Maximizes
    CPU utilization and minimizes disk usage.

: **-update** //SECS//
    Print status updates at intervals of //SECS// seconds. This affects how
    regularly the progress-meter is updated. The default is once per second

: **-mplayeropts** **"**//OPTIONS//**"**
    Append //OPTIONS// to the mplayer command run during video encoding.  Use
    this if you want to add specific video filters (documented in the mplayer
    manual page). Overriding some options will cause encoding to fail, so use
    this with caution!

: **-nofifo** (EXPERIMENTAL)
    Do not use a FIFO pipe for video encoding. If you are getting "Broken pipe"
    errors with normal encoding, try this option.  WARNING: This uses lots of
    disk space (about 2 GB per minute of video).

: **-keepfiles**
    Keep the intermediate files after encoding. Usually, this means the audio
    and video streams are kept (eg the .ac3 and .m2v files for an NTSC DVD).
    This doesn't work with -parallel because the intermediate files are named
    pipes, and not real files.
