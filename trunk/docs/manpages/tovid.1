.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
tovid converts arbitrary video files into (S)VCD/DVD\-compliant MPEG format, suitable for burning to CD/DVD\-R for playback on a standalone DVD player\&.

.SH "FEATURES"

.TP 3
\(bu
Can create a variety of MPEG output formats, including VCD, SVCD, DVD, Half\-DVD, and VCD\-on\-DVD (the \fB\-vcd\fR, \fB\-svcd\fR, \fB\-dvd\fR, \fB\-half\-dvd\fR, and \fB\-dvd\-vcd\fR options, respectively)
.TP
\(bu
Skips encoding of already\-valid video and audio streams, to avoid unnecessary quality degradation
.TP
\(bu
Supports PAL and NTSC output (the \fB\-pal\fR and \fB\-ntsc\fR options)
.TP
\(bu
Automatic aspect ratio detection\&. You can override the auto\-detection with the \fB\-aspect W:H\fR option, or use standard aspect ratios \fB\-full\fR (4:3), \fB\-wide\fR (16:9), and \fB\-panavision\fR (2\&.35:1)\&.
.TP
\(bu
Picture quality enhancement via the \fB\-filters\fR option\&.
.TP
\(bu
Interlaced encoding for all formats except VCD (the \fB\-interlaced\fR option)
.TP
\(bu
Can normalize the volume of too\-loud or too\-soft audio (the \fB\-normalize\fR option)
.TP
\(bu
Automatically splits output files into chunks for burning to multiple CDs or DVDs\&. Use the \fB\-discsize\fR option to specify a custom disc size\&.
.TP
\(bu
Automatic quantization adjustment based on the selected video bitrate\&. High bitrates use low quantization (high quality), while low bitrates use higher quantization\&.
.TP
\(bu
Prints out statistics, including resulting file size, bitrate, and encoding time, and logs statistics to \fI~/\&.tovid/stats\fR
.TP
\(bu
Utilizes multiprocessing during video encoding on systems with more than one CPU
.TP
\(bu
Estimates and reports required space before encoding, and warns if there's not enough space to encode
.TP
\(bu
Progress indicator and estimated completion time shown during encoding
.TP
\(bu
Adjustable priority to prevent encoding from interfering with your other computing activities (the \fB\-priority [low|medium|high]\fR option)
.TP
\(bu
Parallel processing, via the \fB\-parallel\fR option, to help maximize CPU usage during encoding (especially for multi\-CPU encoding)

.SH "ADVANCED OPTIONS"

.SS "Aspect ratios"

.nf

    tovid automatically determines aspect ratio of the input video by
    playing it in mplayer\&. If your video plays with correct aspect in
    mplayer, you should not need to override the default tovid behavior\&.

    If mplayer does not play your video with correct aspect, you may
    provide an explicit aspect ratio in one of several ways:

        \fB\-full\fR           Same as \-aspect 4:3
        \fB\-wide\fR           Same as \-aspect 16:9
        \fB\-panavision\fR     Same as \-aspect 235:100
        \fB\-aspect\fR WIDTH:HEIGHT
            Custom aspect, where WIDTH and HEIGHT are integers\&.

    NOTE: This is the INPUT aspect ratio\&. tovid chooses an optimal
    output aspect ratio for the selected disc format (VCD, DVD, etc\&.)
    and does the appropriate letterboxing or anamorphic scaling\&.

.fi

.SS "Video adjustment"

.nf

  \fB\-quality\fR NUM (EXPERIMENTAL)
        Desired output quality, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10
        giving the best quality at the expense of a larger
        output file\&. Output size can vary by approximately a
        factor of 4 (that is, \-quality 1 output can be 25%
        the size of \-quality 10 output)\&. Your results may vary\&.
        
        At present, this option affects both output
        bitrate and quantization (but may, in the future, affect
        other quality/size\-related attributes)\&. Use \-vbitrate
        if you want to explicitly provide a maximium bitrate\&.
  \fB\-vbitrate\fR NUM
        Maximum bitrate to use for video (in kbits/sec)\&. Must be
        within allowable limits for the given format\&. Overrides
        default values\&. Ignored for VCD\&.
  \fB\-interlaced\fR (EXPERIMENTAL)
        Do interlaced encoding of the input video\&. Use this option if
        your video is interlaced, and you want to preserve as much
        picture quality as possible\&. Ignored for VCD\&.
  \fB\-deinterlace\fR (DEPRECATED)
        Use this option if your source video is interlaced\&. You can
        usually tell if you can see a bunch of horizontal lines when
        you pause the video during playback\&. If you have recorded
        a video from TV or your VCR, it may be interlaced\&. Use this
        option to convert to progressive (non\-interlaced) video\&. This
        option is DEPRECATED, and will probably be ditched in favor of
        interlaced encoding, which is better in almost every way\&.
  \fB\-subtitles\fR FILE
        Get subtitles from FILE and encode them into the video\&.
        WARNING: This hard\-codes the subtitles into the video, and you
        cannot turn them off while viewing the video\&. By default, no
        subtitles are loaded\&. If your video is already compliant with the
        chosen output format, it will be re\-encoded to include the subtitles\&.
  \fB\-type\fR {live|animation|bw}
        Optimize video encoding for different kinds of video\&. Use
        'live' (default) for live\-action video, use 'animation' for
        cartoons or anime, and 'bw' for black\-and\-white video\&.
        This option currently only has an effect with KVCD/KSVCD
        output formats; other formats may support this in the future\&.
  \fB\-safe\fR PERCENT
        Fit the video within a safe area defined by PERCENT\&. For example,
        "\-safe 90%" will scale the video to 90% of the width/height of
        the output resolution, and pad the edges with a black border\&. Use
        this if some of the picture is cut off when played on your TV\&.
        The percent sign is optional\&.
  \fB\-filters\fR {none,denoise,contrast,all} (default none)
        Apply post\-processing filters to enhance the video\&. If your input
        video is very high quality, use 'none'\&. If your input video is grainy,
        use 'denoise'; if it looks washed out or faded, use 'contrast'\&. You
        can use multiple filters separated by commas\&. To apply all filters,
        use 'all'\&.
  \fB\-fps\fR RATIO
        Force input video to be interpreted as [NUM] frames per second\&.
        May be necessary for some ASF, MOV, or other videos\&. NUM
        should be an integer ratio such as "24000:1001" (23\&.976fps),
        "30000:1001" (29\&.97fps), or "25:1" (25fps)\&. This option is
        temporary, and may disappear in future releases\&.

.SS "Audio adjustment"

.nf

  \fB\-normalize\fR
        Normalize the volume of the audio\&. Useful if the audio is too
        quiet or too loud, or you want to make volume consistent for
        a bunch of videos\&.
  \fB\-abitrate\fR \fINUM\fR
        Encode audio at \fINUM\fR kilobits per second\&.
        Reasonable values include 128, 224, and 384\&. The default is 224 kbits/sec,
        good enough for most encodings\&. The value must be within the allowable
        range for the chosen disc format; Ignored for VCD, which must be 224\&.

.fi

.SS "Other options"

.nf

  \fB\-debug\fR             
        Print extra debugging information to the log file\&. Useful in
        diagnosing problems if they occur\&. This option also leaves
        the log file (with a \&.log extension) in the directory after
        encoding finishes\&.
  \fB\-priority\fR {low|medium|high}
        Sets the main encoding process to the given priority\&. With
        high priority, it may take other programs longer to load
        and respond\&. With lower priority, other programs will be
        more responsive, but encoding may take 30\-40% longer\&.
        The default is high priority\&.
  \fB\-discsize\fR \fINUM\fR
        Sets the desired target DVD/CD\-R size to \fINUM\fR MB (10^6)\&.
        Default is 700 for CD, 4500 for DVD\&. Use higher values at your own
        risk\&. Use 650 or lower if you plan to burn to smaller\-capacity CDs\&.
  \fB\-parallel\fR
        Will perform encode/rip processes in parallel using named
        pipes\&. Maximizes CPU utilization and minimizes disk usage\&.
  \fB\-update\fR \fISECS\fR
        Print status updates at intervals of SECS seconds\&. This affects
        how regularly the progress\-meter is updated\&. The default is once
        per second
  \fB\-mplayeropts\fR "\fIOPTIONS\fR"
        Append \fIOPTIONS\fR to the mplayer command run during video encoding\&.
        Use this if you want to add specific video filters (documented in
        the mplayer manual page)\&. Overriding some options will cause
        encoding to fail, so use this with caution!
  \fB\-ffmpeg\fR (EXPERIMENTAL)
        Use ffmpeg for video encoding, instead of mplayer/mpeg2enc\&.
        Encoding will be noticeably faster; (S)VCD and DVD are supported,
        but KVCD/KDVD is not fully supported yet\&.
  \fB\-nofifo\fR (EXPERIMENTAL)
        Do not use a FIFO pipe for video encoding\&. If you are getting
        "Broken pipe" errors with normal encoding, try this option\&.
        WARNING: This uses lots of disk space (about 2 GB per minute of
        video)\&.
