.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
\fBpostproc\fR is designed to do simple post\-processing to finished MPEG videos from \fBtovid\fR\&. After encoding a video with \fBtovid\fR, you may find that the finished video is too large, or has A/V sync problems; this utility can help\&.

.SH "FEATURES"

.TP 3
\(bu
Can adjust the offset between audio and video, if there is an undesirable delay between them\&.
.TP
\(bu
Can requantize ("shrink") video to reduce file size at the expense of quality\&.
.LP

.SH "OPTIONS"

.nf

  \-audiodelay [NUM]
      Delay the audio stream by [NUM] milliseconds\&. Use this if
      your final output has audio that is not synced with the
      video\&. For example, if the audio comes 2 seconds sooner than
      the video, use "\-audiodelay 2000"\&. Use a negative number for
      audio that comes later than the video\&.
  \-shrink [NUM]
      Shrink the video stream by a factor of [NUM]\&. May be a decimal
      value\&. A value of 1\&.0 means the video will be the same size;
      larger values cause more reduction in size\&. Beyond 2\&.0, the
      returns are diminishing\&.
  \-parallel
      Run all processes in parallel and pipe into multiplexer should
      increase speed significantly\&.
  \-debug
      Save output in a temporary file, for later viewing if
      something goes wrong\&.

.SH "USAGE NOTES"

.PP
A note about using the \fB\-shrink\fR option: it is usually best to use this with a value larger than 1\&.0, but smaller than 2\&.0\&. Anything larger than 2\&.0 will not shrink the file by much, as can be seen in the chart to the left\&. Shrink factors are listed across the bottom; the resulting file size for two different test videos are labeled at the left\&. Shrinking results in a 40% size reduction at best, but it can make all the difference in fitting your videos onto a DVD\&. A factor of around 1\&.5 is likely to give the best balance between size and quality\&.

.PP
The chart shown to the left was generated prior to Version 0\&.16, so it's possible that you may be able to get better shrinking with high\-quality (low\-quantization) videos\&. This hasn't been confirmed yet\&.

.PP
For the \fB\-audiodelay\fR option, the best you may be able to do is guess how much the audio and video are offset\&. This option usually executes very quickly (since all it has to do is separate and re\-combine the audio and video streams), so keep trying different values until you find one that works\&.
