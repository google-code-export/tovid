tovid is still in early development, and isn't yet
        available in most package repositories, so you will
        probably not be able to install it using your

        official release of tovid from the <a href=
        "http://sourceforge.net/projects/tovid/" target=

This chapter explains how to get tovid running on your
      computer. If you already have tovid running, then you may
      skip directly to [Using the GUI #gui] or <a href="#cli" title=
      "Using the command-line tools">Using the command-line
      tools.





              <a name=
              "id2450686" id="id2450686">Preliminaries==








                <a name="id2450692" id=
                "id2450692">Requirements===





There are no known minimum system requirements for
          running tovid. If your machine is capable of running a
          standard Linux installation, then you probably have
          enough CPU power for video processing and playback.


If you're going to work with video files, you probably
          want to have plenty of hard drive space to spare; the
          process of authoring a DVD might consume 11GB on your
          disk, and if you are working on several DVD projects at
          once, the space requirements multiply quickly. At
          minimum, you should have about 20GB that you can devote
          to authoring DVDs. If you only plan to create (S)VCDs,
          you could get by with only 6-8GB.


The tovid suite is developed and tested primarily on
          Linux. Some users have also reported successful execution
          on FreeBSD and Cygwin with only minor modifications.
          Parts of the suite may work on other UNIX-like operating
          systems, but that possibility is unverified at this
          point. There are currently no plans to develop a Windows
          or Mac OS port, but if you are interested in taking on
          the job, please contact the tovid developers!


Several software packages are required in order to use
          various components of the tovid suite (see <a href=
          "#sec:Dependencies" title=
          "Dependencies">Dependencies). Nearly all of the
          components, being written in the <strong class=
          "command">bash** scripting language,
          require <strong class=
          "command">bash**, as well as standard UNIX

                "sec:Dependencies">Dependencies===





tovid has amassed some dependency hell during its
          development. Here is the complete list of dependencies,
          and to what extent they are required:



              : <span class=
              "application"><a href="http://www.python.org/"
              target="_top">Python




An interpreter that allows you to run programs
                written in Python. Python is becoming increasingly
                common, so it's good to have a Python interpreter
                installed. If you want to use the graphical
                interface for tovid, you need this.


              : <span class=
              "application"><a href="http://www.wxpython.org/"
              target="_top">wxPython




Provides support for <span class=
                "acronym">GUIs written in Python using the
                wxWidgets API. You
                also need this to run the GUI.


              : <span class=
              "application"><a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/"
              target="_top">mplayer




Probably the most robust and mature video player
                for Linux. Almost all of the tovid components
                depend heavily on mplayer for video playback and
                conversion, so this is a must-install. You'll want
                mplayer anyway, if you plan to be working with
                video.


              : <span class=
              "application"><a href="http://mjpeg.sourceforge.net/"
              target="_top">mjpegtools




Command-line tools for encoding and working with
                video, particularly MPEG. This is required by most
                of tovid's components, and you will need it in
                order to do anything useful with tovid.


              : <span class=
              "application"><a href=
              "http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net/" target=
              "_top">ffmpeg




Tools and libraries for recording, converting,
                and streaming audio and video. Used by several
                components, and required if you want to create DVDs
                in <em class=
                "glossterm">NTSC format.


              : <span class=
              "application"><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org"
              target="_top">ImageMagick




A powerful set of command-line tools for
                formatting, resizing, converting and drawing on
                image files. This is used by the
                <a href="#makemenu"
                title="makemenu">makemenu**, the
                menu-generation component of tovid. If you want to
                create video discs with menus, you need this. Many
                Linux distributions install this by default.


              : <span class=
              "application"><a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/"
              target="_top">SoX




The ImageMagick of audio processing, in a way.
                Command-line tools for converting, trimming, and
                filtering audio files. This is used by
                <a href="#makemenu"
                title="makemenu">makemenu**.


              : <span class=

              "_top">dvdauthor 0.6.0 or
              newer




Tools for creating DVD filesystems. If you want
                to make DVDs with tovid, you need this.


              : <span class=
              "application"><a href="http://www.vcdimager.org/"
              target="_top">vcdimager




Tools for creating (S)VCD filesystems. If you
                want to make VCDs or SVCDs, you need this.


              : <span class=

Video stream processing and conversion tools.
                This is used by postproc (the tovid postprocessing
                component) and <strong class=
                "command"><a href="#dvrequant" title=
                "dvrequant">dvrequant** (the
                tovid DVD shrinking tool). Useful if you want to be
                able to fine-tune the output size of your videos,
                to fit a desired amount of content on a recordable
                DVD.


              : <span class=
              "application"><a href=
              "http://developers.videolan.org/libdvdcss/" target=
              "_top">libdvdcss




DVD decryption routines, used for playing
                encrypted DVDs on your computer. Needed by
                <a href="#dvrequant"
                title="dvrequant">dvrequant** for
                copying encrypted DVDs. You want this.

                "dvrequant">dvrequant**, for
                copying discs.







Most of these tools are widely available in major
          package repositories; chances are good that you can get
          them all through your distribution's preferred package
          manager.

                target="_top">tovid-gui-0.22.tar.gz contains
                the GUI and program icons. The command-line scripts
                must be installed before using the GUI.







Download the command-line package and save it on your
          computer. We'll assume it's saved in <code class=
          "filename">~/Downloads/``.


Next, open a terminal window (such as <span class=
          "application">XTerm, <span class=
          "application">RXVT, or <span class=
          "application">Konsole) and extract the tarball by

$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``cd ~/Downloads``**
$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``tar -xzvf tovid-0.22.tar.gz``**

```



The installation files will go into a subdirectory
          tovid-0.22`` within the
          current directory. Next, do the following:

$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``cd ~/Downloads/tovid-0.22``**
$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``./configure``**
$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``su -c "make install"``**

```



If you decide you don't want tovid installed anymore,
          run make
          uninstall** from the original installation
          directory (<code class=
          "filename">~/Downloads/tovid-0.22``).


Repeat the above procedure for the <code class=
          "filename">tovid-gui-0.22.tar.gz`` package if you
          would like to install the graphical interface.






                <a name="id2495631" id=
                "id2495631">CVS builds===





You can get a copy of the latest development version
          of tovid through CVS. To get this version, you need to
          have <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/" target=
          "_top">CVS installed.


Using CVS is a little different; instead of just
          downloading tovid, you'll be "checking out" a copy of it.
          Using the same example directory as above:

$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``cd ~/Downloads``**
$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/tovid login``**
<code class=

$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/tovid co -P gui``**

$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``aclocal``**
$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``autoconf``**
$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``automake``**

```



If you're installing the GUI, repeat these steps in
          its directory (<strong class=
          "command">aclocal**, <strong class=
          "command">autoconf**, and
          automake**).
          Finally, do <strong class=
          "command">./configure** and
          su -c "make
          install"** as shown above in each
          repsective directory to install tovid (and the GUI)
          system-wide.

The tovid GUI (<strong class=
      "command">tovidgui.py**) is the user-friendly
      face of tovid. From the GUI, you can layout, encode, and burn
      a [VCD #VCD], <a href=
      "#SVCD">SVCD, or <a href=
      "#DVD">DVD with menus and
      videos.


The GUI is primarily a front-end for the command-line
      interface components; aside from minor interactive features,
      the GUI cannot do anything the command-line tools cannot do.
      If you prefer to use a command-line interface, you may wish

Assuming you have installed the tovid suite to your path
        (see the installation instructions above), all you need to
        do is execute <strong class=
        "command">tovidgui.py**. The tovid GUI will
        not work properly unless you have installed the suite to
        your path.


The tovid GUI has no command-line options at this
        time.






              <a name=
              "id2496017" id="id2496017">How it works==





The tovid GUI, as currently designed, operates on a
        simple notion: You provide video files, and optionally
        provide a background image or audio clip for each menu. The
        GUI performs all the necessary conversion, and creates an
        (S)VCD or DVD:

Following is a brief tour of the tovid GUI and how to
        use it. At this time, the GUI is designed with a relatively
        simple task in mind: Create a video disc, using a bunch of
        videos that you provide. The GUI handles all the necessary
        conversion (using <a href=
        "#tovid" title="tovid">tovid**), menu
        creation (using <a href=
        "#makemenu" title="makemenu">makemenu**),
        and disc authoring (using <strong class=
        "command"><a href="#makexml" title=
        "makexml">makexml**).

                <a name="id2496135" id=
                "id2496135">Startup screen===





When you first start the tovid GUI, you will see a
          screen something like this:





**Figure&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Choosing a disc
            format**



                <img src="images/gui_disc_format.png" alt=
                "Choosing a disc format">





The Disc layout tree on
          the left-hand side represents the layout of your disc. It
          will grow as you begin to add menus and videos. In the
          Disc options panel to the
          right, you can choose what sort of disc you want to make.
          If you have a DVD-recordable drive, you can create DVDs;
          if you have a CD-recordable drive, you can create VCDs
          and SVCDs.





**Figure&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Disc layout
            tree and temporary directory**



                <img src="images/gui_disc_working_dir.png" alt=
                "Disc layout tree and temporary directory">





Also in the Disc options
          panel, you can choose a working directory to use for
          temporary files needed during encoding. This directory
          should have enough space to encode all the videos, so be
          sure to pick a directory with several gigabytes
          available, especially if you are creating a large DVD
          disc.


In the Disc layout tree,
          you can edit the title of an item by clicking on it.
          Click on the title next to the disc icon if you want to
          change the title of the disc.


When you are satisfied with the options you have
          chosen here, select the Add
          menu button to begin adding content to the disc. A
          menu is necessary in order to navigate the disc, so you
          must add a menu before going any further. You can always
          come back to this screen by selecting the disc icon in
          the tree.






                <a name="id2496236" id=
                "id2496236">Adding a menu===





Proceed with disc creation by selecting the
          Add menu button. When you
          add a menu, you will see a new screen something like
          this:

                <img src="images/gui_menu_options.png" alt=
                "Setting up a menu">





When a menu is selected in the <span class=
          "guilabel">Disc layout tree, the encoding options
          relevant to that menu are shown in the <span class=
          "guilabel">Menu options panel to the right. Once
          again, you can click on the title of the menu in the tree
          (next to the menu icon) to edit the menu's title.


In the Menu options
          panel, you can choose an image to be shown in the
          background of the menu, and an audio clip to be played
          while the menu is displayed. If you do not choose a
          background image or audio clip, a default background will
          be used, and no sound will be played while the menu is
          shown. Here, you can also configure the font, alignment,
          and color of items listed in the menu.


Now that you have a menu, you can add some videos to
          the disc by selecting the Add
          video(s) button.

          <div class="note" style=
          "margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">

              Note



The Add slide(s)
            button will be used in the future for adding slideshows
            to a disc. As of version 0.22, this feature is still
            disabled.







                <a name="id2496329" id=
                "id2496329">Adding videos===





When you select Add
          video(s), a file chooser will be displayed that
          you can use to select one or more videos to add under the
          selected menu. After adding some videos, the screen looks
          something like this:





**Figure&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Adding
            videos**



                <img src="images/gui_videos_added.png" alt=
                "Adding videos">





Videos are listed in the tree with a film-strip icon
          next to them. Once again, you can click their titles to
          edit them; initially, the title of each video is the same
          as its filename. You'll notice the <span class=
          "guilabel">Menu options panel now displays a list
          of titles shown on that menu; the selected font,
          alignment, and color will apply to these titles when they
          are displayed on the final menu.






                <a name="id2496379" id=
                "id2496379">Multiple menus===





If you have a lot of videos, you may want to divide
          your disc up into several sub-menus. To do this, just
          select Add menu again. If
          you do, the layout tree will change to look like the
          following:





**Figure&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Adding another
            menu**



                <img src="images/gui_second_menu_added.png" alt=
                "Adding another menu">





Notice that a "Main menu" has appeared above the two
          untitled menus. This main menu is used to navigate to the
          other menus. You can put as many videos as you like under
          each menu. You can change the font, color, and background
          of the main menu just like you can for other menus; the
          difference is that the main menu links to other menus,
          rather than videos.


If you want to use the same font, alignment,
          background, and colors for all the menus on your disc,
          choose Use these settings for all
          menus. This button will copy the current settings
          to all the menus on the disc.


The main menu links to each of the sub-menus below it,
          and each sub-menu will automatically include a "Back"
          link that returns to the main menu. Regardless of how
          many menus you add, the first menu that is listed in the
          Disc layout tree will be
          the first one you see when you play the disc.






                <a name="id2496448" id=
                "id2496448">Video options===





Now that some videos have been added, you can decide
          how you want to encode them. When you select a video in
          the tree, the Video options
          panel is displayed, showing all the configuration options
          that apply to that video:





**Figure&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Video
            options**



                <img src="images/gui_video_enc_opts.png" alt=
                "Video options">





The output resolution for each video depends on the
          disc format you have chosen; certain resolutions are not
          available with certain formats. If you don't like the
          available video resolutions, you can go back and change
          the disc format by clicking on the disc icon in the tree.
          You can also choose an aspect ratio to use for the video;
          widescreen formats will be letterboxed if necessary, to
          display correctly on your TV.


If you want to, you can also adjust the video and
          audio bitrates. The default values are usually
          reasonable, so you can leave these alone if you aren't
          sure what bitrate to use. Finally, you can enable
          additional options such as audio normalization (useful if
          the audio is too loud or too quiet), low-quality video
          (if you want faster encoding at the expense of quality),
          or video deinterlacing (if the source video was recorded
          from interlaced broadcast or VHS).


To use the same settings for all the videos on the
          disc, select the Use these
          settings for all videos button. The
          currently-selected resolution, aspect ratio, bitrates and
          other options will be applied to all videos in the disc
          layout tree.


You can use the Move
          up, Move down, and
          Remove buttons in the
          layout tree to position elements where you want them or
          remove them from the disc.


When you are satisfied with the layout of your disc,
          select the Next: Encoding
          setup button to proceed with encoding and
          authoring the disc:





**Figure&nbsp;8.&nbsp;A complete disc
            layout**



                <img src="images/gui_layout_done.png" alt=
                "A complete disc layout">





You will probably want to make sure all your menu and
          video titles are the way you want them before proceeding,
          so double-check to be sure there are no more "Untitled"
          items in the tree. But don't worry&ndash;you can come
          back to this screen if you click the button by
          accident.






                <a name="id2496572" id=
                "id2496572">Encoding everything===





When you select Next: Encoding
          setup, you will be taken to a new panel showing a
          log window of command output:





**Figure&nbsp;9.&nbsp;Getting ready
            to encode**



                <img src="images/gui_encoding_setup.png" alt=
                "Getting ready to encode">





In the 0.18a preview release, the "Output directory"
          is ignored (but in the official release, will be the
          place where the disc image is written). Select
          Next: Begin encoding to
          start everything running. If you have selected many
          videos, this step may take several hours. The log output
          will be updated regularly to keep you informed about the
          encoding progress. When it is done, the next step is to
          create the disc image by authoring the final disc
          structure.






                <a name="id2496626" id=
                "id2496626">Creating the disc image===





In the 0.18a preview release of the tovid GUI, you
          must do this step by hand. The GUI will inform you when
          the XML file is ready to be authored; if you are making a
          VCD or SVCD, you need to use vcdxbuild to author the
          disc, using a command like <strong class=
          "command">vcdxbuild /path/to/output.xml**.
          If you're using any of the DVD formats, you must use
          dvdauthor to author it, using a command like
          dvdauthor -x
          /path/to/output.xml**. The GUI will tell
          you the full path name of the XML file.


The final release of 0.18 will at least have authoring
          capability, but it may still be necessary to burn the
          disc by hand using cdrecord, K3B, etc.






                <a name="id2496661" id=
                "id2496661">Development screenshots===





GUI development is progressing steadily, and the above
          screenshots may not exactly resemble what you see in your
          GUI. This tour will be updated periodically as the
          functionality of the GUI grows, but due to the
          time-consuming nature of putting together updated
          screenshots, this tour may not be updated for every new
          GUI release.


This section shows several screenshots from the
          development version of the tovid GUI (currently version
          0.18), with a short description of what is shown on the
          screen.





**Figure&nbsp;10.&nbsp;Guide
            system**



                <img src="images/gui_devel_guide_panel_thumb.png"
                alt="Guide system">





Guide panel. This is a
          new help system that has been implemented to aid the user
          in getting from one step to the next. The guide panel is
          a long skinny box of text that describes what the current
          task in the GUI is, and what you might want to do next.
          This panel makes the GUI take up significantly more
          screen space, so a new View
          menu has been added, which includes the option to
          hide/show the guide panel.


This approach was chosen because it offers great
          possibilities for a very convenient complete help system.
          In future versions, this panel could be functionally
          enhanced, interactive (with hypertext links to related
          topics) and searchable. It will more closely resemble the
          navigation panel of a standard Windows help dialog, and
          will consist of formatted text, images, etc. written in
          HTML.


The advantage this has over a traditional help system,
          with its own separate dialogs, is reduced window
          maintenance. Whenever I'm browsing help, I'm usually
          trying to do something with the program at the same time.
          This way, I don't have to manually size the help and main
          GUI windows, arrange them side-by-side, etc. It's already
          right there, and designed for optimal presentation of
          help and GUI side-by-side.


Doing this would almost certainly require splitting
          the GUI up into many dependent files; the HTML used for
          such a help system needs to be formatted specifically so
          wxWidgets can use it, and would consist of several
          separate files. These would most sensibly need to be
          installed in your <code class=
          "filename">/usr/local/share/doc`` or a similar
          location, which would mean the tovid installer would need
          updating, and almost certainly a user-level configuration
          file would need to be saved (so the GUI knows where to
          find the documentation files).


So, for now, the guide panel is simply a few
          paragraphs of text, hard-coded into the GUI code. But
          it's a good start, and it has many possibilities!







              <a name=
              "id2496767" id="id2496767">Future plans==





A number of additional features are planned for the
        tovid GUI. Among the things I have in mind (more or less in
        order of priority):



            - 

A built-in help system.


            - 

Slide-show capability. This would require a
              <a href="#makexml"
              title="makexml">makexml**
              implementation, if DVD slideshows are to be
              allowed.


            - 

Front-ends to <strong class=
              "command">postproc**,
              <a href="#idvid" title=
              "idvid">idvid**, and
              <a href="#dvrequant"
              title="dvrequant">dvrequant**.


            - 

"Estimated disk space left" meter on the disc
              layout panel. This would be a horizontal bar that
              fills up as you add videos to the disc; the required
              size for each video would be estimated to give the
              user an idea of when there is no more space. User
              will be warned if maximum space is exceeded.


            - 

Previewing items on the disc, including menus,
              videos, and slideshows.


            - 

When browsing for images, an image browser that
              shows thumbnails of each image, to make finding
              desired slides or background images easier


            - 

Capability to add extra audio/video tracks to a
              video. This would allow producing discs with multiple
              camera angles, or multiple audio tracks including
              translations, commentary, etc. This would have to be
              implemented in <a href=
              "#tovid" title="tovid">tovid**
              itself, also.


            - 

Capability to add subtitles (as a subtitle stream)
              to videos. This would also require a
              <a href="#tovid" title=
              "tovid">tovid** implementation
              first.


            - 

Capability to add chapter breaks to videos,
              perhaps in conjunction with the video previewing
              capability. This would require a <strong class=
              "command"><a href="#makexml" title=
              "makexml">makexml**
              implementation.


            - 

Drag-n-drop for adding/rearranging videos/slides
              to the disc layout tree.


            - 

Capability to save/load disc layouts in progress;
              possibly in conjunction with this, a capability to
              interrupt/resume the disc encoding process.

This chapter gives an overview of how to use the

      "tovid suite manual pages">manpages for more detailed
      usage notes.


If using the command line does not sound like your cup of
      tea, you may choose the tovid GUI instead. The GUI makes the
      disc authoring process much simpler and more interactive. See
      [Using the GUI #gui].





              <a name=
              "id2496992" id="id2496992">The scripts==





tovid's foundation
        rests on a collection of shell scripts designed for
        specific tasks relevant to authoring a video disc. One
        script converts video, another makes menus, another
        generates the disc navigation structure, etc. Here's how it
        all fits together:





**Figure&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Organization of
          the tools**


            <img src="images/tovid_cli_organization.jpg" alt=
            "Organization of the tools">




The blue gear icons are the primary tovid scripts. Each
        script has certain inputs and outputs; for example, the
        <a href="#tovid" title=
        "tovid">tovid** script takes any
        multimedia video file as input, and produces (S)VCD or
        DVD-compliant MPEG video files as output. The output of
        <a href="#tovid" title=
        "tovid">tovid** then becomes an input to
        makevcd** or
        <a href="#makedvd" title=
        "makedvd">makedvd**, and so on.


tovid follows the UNIX tradition of modularization.
        Rather than having a single large program that does
        everything, tovid has several smaller programs that do
        specific things:



            - 

<a href="#tovid"
              title="tovid">tovid** converts
              arbitrary multimedia video files to (S)VCD, DVD, or
              KVCD-compliant format.


            - 

<a href="#makemenu"
              title="makemenu">makemenu** create
              an MPEG menu, for navigating a video disc.


            - 

<a href="#makexml"
              title="makexml">makexml** generates
              an XML description of video disc content, compatible
              with <strong class=
              "command">vcdxbuild** or
              <strong class=
              "command">dvdauthor**.


            - 

<a href="#makedvd"
              title="makedvd">makedvd** authors
              and optionally burns a DVD.


            - 

<strong class=
              "command">makevcd** authors and
              optionally burns a VCD or SVCD (not yet complete)










                <a name="id2497157" id=
                "id2497157">Five steps===





Creating a video disc using the command-line tools
          boils down to five steps:



              - 

Plan
                ahead. Decide what videos you would
                like to include on the disc, and whether you want
                to make an (S)VCD or a DVD. If you have lots of
                videos, you may want to have navigational menus to
                select them for playback. Sketch out an outline of
                what menus you want to have, and what videos they
                will link to.


              - 

Encode the
                content. Almost all video sources need
                to be converted to an (S)VCD or DVD-compliant
                format. The <a href=
                "#tovid" title="tovid">tovid**
                script does this for you; use it to convert all the
                videos you want to include. You can use
                <strong class=
                "command">tovid-batch** to convert
                several videos at once.


              - 

Create menus
                (optional). If you want your disc to
                have interactive menus for navigation, use
                <a href="#makemenu"
                title="makemenu">makemenu** to
                create them. This is where you will specify video
                titles, as they will appear on the menu.


              - 

Layout the
                disc. This is where you specify exactly
                how your disc will be organized. Provide the names
                of all your video and menu files, and
                <a href="#makexml"
                title="makexml">makexml** does
                the rest.


              - 

Author and
                burn. When you reach this step, you
                should have several <code class=
                "filename">.mpg`` files (menus and videos),
                along with a .xml``
                file containing the disc layout. Give the
                .xml`` file to

There are several additional scripts customized for
          other tasks:



              - 

<a href=
                "#dvrequant" title=
                "dvrequant">dvrequant** copies a
                single track, with optional subtitles and multiple
                audio streams, from an existing DVD.


              - 

<a href="#idvid"
                title="idvid">idvid** identifies
                video files, telling you the duration, resolution,
                codec, and other useful information. Perhaps most
                important, it can tell you whether a given video
                file is compliant with (S)VCD or DVD.


              - 

<strong class=
                "command">makeslides** creates a
                still-image slideshow, in (S)VCD format, from
                arbitrary images. Slideshows may be included on a
                disc using the -slides``
                option to <a href=
                "#makexml" title=
                "makexml">makexml**.


              - 

<strong class=
                "command">postproc** does
                post-processing on an encoded/compliant MPEG video.
                It can shrink the video stream by reducing quality,
                and it can adjust the audio/video
                synchronization.


              - 

<strong class=
                "command">tovid-batch** processes
                multiple video files using the same output options.
                Use this if you want to encode several videos to
                the same format.


              - 

<strong class=
                "command">tovid-interactive** is an
                interactive command-line tool that prompts you for
                all the necessary <strong class=
                "command"><a href="#tovid" title=
                "tovid">tovid** encoding options.
                Use this if you are unfamiliar with the command
                line, but do not want to run the GUI for whatever
                reason.







Each of these is described in more detail in the
          sections that follow.







              <a name=
              "cli.config" id="cli.config">Configuration
              files==





The version-0.18 <a href=
        "#tovid" title="tovid">tovid** script
        implements the use of configuration files. Eventually, all
        the major tovid scripts will be able to read configuration
        files from a global directory, a user-preference directory,
        and from a supplied text file.


Configuration files for the tovid suite are plain ASCII
        text. The first line of the file begins with a script name
        (such as <strong class=
        "command">tovid**, <strong class=
        "command">makexml**, or <strong class=
        "command">makemenu**); the remainder of the
        file consists of command-line options appropriate to that
        script. Whitespace is ignored, and comments may be included
        on lines beginning with #``.

tovid
# sample tovid configuration file

# This is a comment, and will be ignored by tovid

# Always use NTSC format by default
-ntsc

# Run in "parallel" mode for faster execution and
# reduced disk usage
-parallel

# Run in "debug" mode, so when something goes wrong
# it's easier to diagnose
-debug

# Always overwrite existing output files.
-overwrite

```



This format makes editing a snap, especially if you are
        already familiar with tovid's various command-line options.
        You may find configuration files useful, if you get tired
        of entering the same options by hand for a bunch of videos,
        or if you want to customize your bitrates, menus, or
        formats for a certain project.

This document explains how to create a DVD using the tovid
      suite. It assumes you have a collection of videos, in various
      formats, and want to end up with a finished DVD with menus.
      Each step of the DVD-creation process is explained in
      detail.





              <a name=
              "id2497608" id="id2497608">Getting started==





Before we begin, we need several things:



            - 

Some videos. Where you get them is up to you.


            - 

The tovid suite of utilities, which you can
              download from <a href=
              "http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/tovid" target=
              "_top">sourceforge.net.


            - 

The <a href="documentation.html" target=
              "_top">tovid documentation, for reference on how
              to install and use tovid


            - 

A command-line interface. Any terminal or console
              will do.


            - 

Some patience, and perhaps a nice cup of
              coffee







I'm going to be authoring a DVD with four videos on
        it:



            - 

Serenity.mpg``, a
              trailer for <a href=
              "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379786/" target=
              "_top">Serenity, the <span class=
              "emphasis">Firefly movie


            - 

HHGG.mpg``, a trailer
              for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371724/"
              target="_top">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
              Galaxy movie


            - 

ROTB.mov``, a
              computer-animated <a href="http://www.lego.com/"
              target="_top">LEGO short featuring Star Wars
              characters


            - 

MGS4.wmv``, a trailer
              for the PS3 game <a href=
              "http://www.konami.jp/gs/kojima_pro/japanese/mgs4_04.html"
              target="_top">Metal Gear Solid 4











              <a name=
              "id2497733" id="id2497733">Converting the
              videos==





Videos come in all kinds of formats, but <a href=
        "#DVD">DVD only accepts a
        few specific standard formats. Fortunately, you don't have
        to worry much about it, because the <strong class=
        "command"><a href="#tovid" title=
        "tovid">tovid** script does all the
        conversion for you. You tell it what video you want to
        encode (the -in`` option), and
        what name you want for the output file (the <code class=
        "option">-out`` option). For example:

$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``tovid -in MGS4.wmv -out Metal_Gear_Solid_4``**

```



This will convert MGS4.wmv``
        to [NTSC #NTSC] DVD
        format, saving the result as <code class=
        "filename">Metal_Gear_Solid_4.mpg``. Since this is the
        output format I want to use, all I have to do is run the
        above command on each of my videos:

$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``tovid -in Serenity.mpg -out Serenity_trailer``**
$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``tovid -in HHGG.mpg -out Hitchhikers_Guide``**
$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``tovid -in ROTB.mpg -out Revenge_of_the_Brick``**
$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``tovid -in MGS4.mpg -out Metal_Gear_Solid_4``**

```


        <div class="note" style=
        "margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">

            Note



You can customize your output video with additional
          options, for example:

$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``tovid -pal -half-dvd -in MGS4.wmv -out Metal_Gear_Solid_4``**

```



This will convert to <em class=
          "glossterm">PAL format, using a "half-sized" DVD
          resolution (352x480). There are many other options for
          further customizing your output video; see the
          <a href="#tovid" title=
          "tovid">tovid** documentation, or run
          tovid -help**
          to see a complete list of them.



After running a tovid command, it's time to get that cup
        of coffee. Video encoding takes a long time! But if all
        goes well, I'll end up with four output videos:
        Serenity_trailer.mpg``,
        Hitchhikers_Guide.mpg`` and so
        on.






              <a name=
              "id2497929" id="id2497929">Creating the menu==





Next, I'd like to create a navigational menu, so that
        when I play the DVD, I can choose which video to play. DVD
        menus are themselves videos, but they have some extra stuff
        that makes them behave like menus. But again, you don't
        need to worry about all the details; just use the
        <a href="#makemenu" title=
        "makemenu">makemenu** script:

$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``makemenu "Serenity trailer" \
           "Hitchhiker's Guide trailer" \
           "Revenge of the Brick" \
           "Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer" \
           MiscTrailers``**

```


        <div class="note" style=
        "margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">

            Note



The backslash at the end of each line indicates
          continuation on the next line; you can enter this command
          exactly as it appears, with backslashes, or you can enter
          it all on a single line, without backslashes.



I specify the four titles I want on the menu by
        enclosing them each in double-quotes, separated by spaces.
        The last thing is the name I want to use for the menu
        itself. When this command is done, I should have a video
        file called <code class=
        "filename">MiscTrailers.mpg``.





**Figure 1. What the menu looks
          like**


            <img src="images/howto_menu_screenshot.jpg" alt=
            "What the menu looks like">




When it's eventually authored as a DVD menu, it will
        have a yellow highlight that can be used to select a
        title.






              <a name=
              "id2498017" id="id2498017">Defining the
              structure==





The next step is to define how the DVD will be
        structured. The popular <a href=
        "http://dvdauthor.sourceforge.net/" target=
        "_top">dvdauthor tool can create a DVD file structure
        based on an XML input file in a predetermined format. But
        guess what! You don't need to worry about this format
        either, because the <a href=
        "#makexml" title="makexml">makexml**
        script can create it for you. All you need to provide is
        the filenames of your menus and videos, along with a few
        other options.


I'm using a pretty simple structure: a single menu, with
        four video titles. Here's the command I would run:

$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``makexml \
    -menu MiscTrailers.mpg \
        Serenity_trailer.mpg \
        Hitchhikers_Guide.mpg \
        Revenge_of_the_Brick.mpg \
        Metal_Gear_Solid_4.mpg \
    TrailerDisc``**

```



As you might have guessed, the first filename after
        -menu`` is the video containing
        the menu itself. All the filenames after that are the
        videos that are linked from that menu, in the same order
        that they are listed in the menu. Finally, the last thing
        is the name to use for output. When this command finishes,
        I'll have TrailerDisc.xml``
        containing a valid <strong class=
        "command">dvdauthor** disc structure.






              <a name=
              "id2498098" id="id2498098">Authoring and
              burning==





The <a href="#makedvd"
        title="makedvd">makedvd** script
        automates much of the process of authoring and burning the
        disc from the XML file created above. All that remains to
        do is:

$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``makedvd -burn TrailerDisc.xml``**

```



You can leave out the -burn``
        option, if you'd like to just author the disc and create an
        ISO image. Then, you can run the same command again with
        -burn`` to burn the
        already-created ISO.

My encoded video plays back extremely fast, as
                if it's in fast-forward.








For some reason, certain video codecs are
                identified as using 1000 frames per second. (You
                can see this by running <strong class=
                "command"><a href="#idvid" title=
                "idvid">idvid** on the video.)
                You may be able to fix it by re-encoding using the
                -fps`` option to force a
                framerate.




              <a name="id2498200" id=
              "id2498200"><a name="id2498202" id=
              "id2498202">**2.**



Why is it so slow?








Short answer: because video encoding is a very
                CPU-intensive process. Longer, more complicated
                answer: because there are many factors that can
                influence encoding time, including, but not limited
                to: the speed of your CPU, the format of the input
                video, the resolution you're encoding to, and the
                bitrate, quality, and denoising that are in effect.
                While I don't have very detailed statistics on
                encoding times yet, in my experience it's common
                for encoding to take two to three times the length
                of the video on my AMD Athlon 1600XP. So if you're
                encoding a 2-hour movie, it could take from four to
                six hours, depending on your CPU speed. DVD output
                takes longer than VCD or SVCD output. There are
                most likely some performance improvements that
                could be made, but for now you can probably expect
                that encoding video will take a long time.




              <a name="id2498227" id=
              "id2498227"><a name="id2498229" id=
              "id2498229">**3.**



Why is my CPU only showing 50% usage during
                encoding?








This is another complex question that I don't
                have a good answer for. The performance of tovid is
                steadily improving with each new release, and my
                goal is to have the potential for near-100% CPU
                usage during encoding, but unfortunately it's not
                quite that simple. This situation should be much
                improved as of version 0.18, which includes the
                -parallel`` option for
                both <a href="#tovid"
                title="tovid">tovid** and
                <strong class=
                "command">postproc**; try using this
                option if you find that your CPU is not being
                utilized fully.

              "id2498268">**4.**



What fonts can I use in <strong class=

                I have so few fonts to choose from when making
                menus from the GUI)?

It probably means you don't have permission to
                burn DVDs, and must burn them as the root user. To
                burn as root, run su

tovid-suite &mdash; Create video discs





          ==Description==


The tovid suite is a
          collection of special-purpose command-line tools with the
          combined goal of creating standards-compliant video discs
          in formats including Video CD (VCD), Super Video CD
          (SVCD), and DVD.

          ==Name==


tovid &mdash; Convert video to (S)VCD/DVD format



          ==Synopsis==



tovid`` [ <em class=
            "replaceable">``OPTIONS`` ] {
            -in`` <em class=
            "replaceable">``INFILE`` <code class=
            "option">-out`` <em class=
            "replaceable">``OUTPREFIX`` }






          ==Description==


tovid converts arbitrary video files into
          (S)VCD/DVD-compliant MPEG format, suitable for burning to
          CD/DVD-R for playback on a standalone DVD player.





          ==Features==



              - 

Can create a variety of MPEG output formats,
                including VCD, SVCD, DVD, Half-DVD, and VCD-on-DVD
                (the -vcd``, <code class=
                "option">-svcd``, <code class=
                "option">-dvd``, <code class=
                "option">-half-dvd``, and <code class=
                "option">-dvd-vcd`` options, respectively)


              - 

Skips encoding of already-valid video and audio
                streams, to avoid unnecessary quality
                degradation


              - 

Supports PAL and NTSC output (the <code class=
                "option">-pal`` and <code class=
                "option">-ntsc`` options)


              - 

Automatic aspect ratio detection. You can
                override the auto-detection with the <code class=
                "option">-aspect W:H`` option, or use standard
                aspect ratios -full``
                (4:3), -wide`` (16:9),
                and -panavision``
                (2.35:1).


              - 

Picture quality enhancement via the <code class=
                "option">-filters`` option.


              - 

Interlaced encoding for all formats except VCD
                (the -interlaced``
                option)


              - 

Can normalize the volume of too-loud or too-soft
                audio (the -normalize``
                option)


              - 

Automatically splits output files into chunks
                for burning to multiple CDs or DVDs. Use the
                -discsize`` option to
                specify a custom disc size.


              - 

Automatic quantization adjustment based on the
                selected video bitrate. High bitrates use low
                quantization (high quality), while low bitrates use
                higher quantization.


              - 

Prints out statistics, including resulting file
                size, bitrate, and encoding time, and logs
                statistics to <code class=
                "filename">~/.tovid/stats``


              - 

Utilizes multiprocessing during video encoding
                on systems with more than one CPU


              - 

Estimates and reports required space before
                encoding, and warns if there's not enough space to
                encode


              - 

Progress indicator and estimated completion time
                shown during encoding


              - 

Adjustable priority to prevent encoding from
                interfering with your other computing activities
                (the -priority
                [low|medium|high]`` option)


              - 

Parallel processing, via the <code class=
                "option">-parallel`` option, to help maximize
                CPU usage during encoding (especially for multi-CPU
                encoding)

          an optional background image or audio clip, or by using
          custom font and font color.





          ==Features==



              - 

Can create VCD, SVCD, or DVD menus in PAL or

          ==Usage notes==


makexml**
          checks to make sure the video filenames you give it
          exist, but it does not check whether they are valid for
          the chosen disc format. MPEG videos of menus should have
          the specified number of buttons for reaching each of the
          videos, and, if you're using DVD, should be multiplexed
          with their corresponding subtitles using
          spumux** of
          the dvdauthor 0.6.0 package prior to authoring using
          dvdauthor. If you use the <strong class=
          "command"><a href="#makemenu" title=
          "makemenu">makemenu** component to
          generate the menu, this should all be handled for
          you.

          ==Features==



              - 

Can adjust the offset between audio and video,
                if there is an undesirable delay between them.


              - 

Can requantize ("shrink") video to reduce file
                size at the expense of quality.

          ==Usage notes==



              [images/shrink_chart.png]




A note about using the <code class=
          "option">-shrink`` option: it is usually best to use
          this with a value larger than 1.0, but smaller than 2.0.
          Anything larger than 2.0 will not shrink the file by
          much, as can be seen in the chart to the left. Shrink
          factors are listed across the bottom; the resulting file
          size for two different test videos are labeled at the
          left. Shrinking results in a 40% size reduction at best,
          but it can make all the difference in fitting your videos
          onto a DVD. A factor of around 1.5 is likely to give the
          best balance between size and quality.


The chart shown to the left was generated prior to
          Version 0.16, so it's possible that you may be able to
          get better shrinking with high-quality (low-quantization)
          videos. This hasn't been confirmed yet.


For the -audiodelay``
          option, the best you may be able to do is guess how much
          the audio and video are offset. This option usually
          executes very quickly (since all it has to do is separate
          and re-combine the audio and video streams), so keep
          trying different values until you find one that
          works.

It's often hard to compare the quality of two videos
        simply by watching them. The human eye is very forgiving
        when it comes to video, and it's useful to do a
        frame-by-frame comparison.


To get a dump of every frame in VIDEO, use the following
        command:

$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``mplayer -nosound -vo png VIDEO``**

```



If you want to see the difference between two images
        (IMAGE_1 and IMAGE_2), use one of these commands:

$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``convert IMAGE_1 IMAGE_2 -compose difference -composite x: &``**
$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``convert IMAGE_1 IMAGE_2 -compose difference -composite -normalize x: &``**

```



These commands use <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/"
        target="_top">ImageMagick to display a grayscale
        representation of the difference between IMAGE_1 and
        IMAGE_2, with lighter areas indicating greater difference.
        The -normalize`` option is useful
        for images that are very similar. Use this to get a quick
        visualization of image quality, in particular the
        degredation and artifacts that are often introduced during
        conversion to another image format.


Newer versions of ImageMagick include the
        compare**
        utility. Try:

$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``compare IMAGE_1 IMAGE_2 x: &``**

```



If you like numbers, you might enjoy:

$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``compare -metric MAE IMAGE_1 IMAGE_2 null:``**

```



Try the metrics MSE, PSE, PSNR, and RMSE for different
        comparison types. For more on comparing images, see
        <a href="http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~anthony/info/graphics/image_comparing"

Starting with version 0.18, <strong class=
        "command"><a href="#tovid" title=
        "tovid">tovid** writes statistics to
        ~/.tovid/stats`` in a
        comma-separated quoted-string format commonly known as
        <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values"
        target="_top">CSV (not to be confused with <a href=
        "http://www.cvshome.org/" target="_top">CVS). This
        makes the statistics easily parsable, particularly if you
        want to import them into a spreadsheet for further analysis
        or graphing.


Here's how I go about importing the stats into <a href=

        "_top">OpenOffice.org Calc:

$`` <strong class=
"userinput">``cp ~/.tovid/stats ~/.tovid/stats.csv``**

```



It helps if the file has a <code class=
        "filename">.csv`` extension, because then OOo Calc
        assumes it contains comma-separated values. Run OOo Calc,
        and open ~/.tovid/stats.csv``.
        You'll be presented with a dialog:

              ratio?==





In video processing, the <span class=
        "emphasis">aspect ratio is a pair of
        numbers that expresses the "wideness" of an image or video.
        The two numbers are a width-to-height ratio. For example,
        an aspect ratio of 4:3`` means
        the picture is 4 units wide for every 3 units in
        height.





**Figure&nbsp;B.1.&nbsp;What 4:3
          means**


            [images/4_3_grid.jpg]




Typical 1980s-1990s TV sets have this aspect ratio, as
        do most computer monitors. In the early 2000s, <a href=
        "#HDTV">High-definition TV
        (HDTV) screens have become more popular and affordable;
        HDTVs commonly have a 16:9 aspect ratio.





**Figure&nbsp;B.2.&nbsp;A 16:9
          picture**


            [images/16_9_grid.jpg]




To find the aspect ratio of a video or image, just
        measure its width and height. The aspect ratio can then be
        expressed as width:height``. If
        the picture is 24cm wide and 18cm tall, the aspect ratio
        can be expressed 24:18``.

        <div class="note" style=
        "margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">

            Note



The aspect ratio is expressed in terms of the
          intended display
          dimensions. The resolution of an image in
          pixels is not always a good indicator of aspect ratio.
          For more on why this is so, see <a href=
          "http://www.mir.com/DMG/aspect.html" target="_top">Aspect
          Ratios and Frame Sizes.



How does 24:18`` compare to
        other aspect ratios? Is wider or narrower than other aspect
        ratios like 16:9`` or
        4:3``? It's hard to tell at a
        glance, because the denominators are different. The easiest
        way to compare aspect ratios is to reduce them to lowest
        terms by doing a simple division:

24 / 18 = 1.33
 4 /  3 = 1.33
16 /  9 = 1.78

```



The first two aspect ratios are equivalent to
        1.33:1``. Both are narrower than
        the widescreen aspect ratio of <code class=
        "literal">1.78:1``. Reducing aspect ratios to their
        lowest terms makes comparison easier.





**Figure B.3. Visual comparison of
          aspect ratios**


            <img src="images/Aspect_ratios.png" alt=
            "Visual comparison of aspect ratios">




Two other aspect ratios are commonly used in filming
        movies: 1.85:1`` (Academy
        Standard, or "flat"), and <code class=
        "literal">2.35:1`` (or "Scope", also called Panavision
        or CinemaScope). Both are even wider than <code class=
        "literal">16:9``, with Scope being almost twice as
        wide as 4:3``. The term
        "widescreen" typically refers to any aspect ratio greater
        than about 1.33:1``.

        out <a href=

              <a name=
              "id2501290" id="id2501290">Converting between
              aspect ratios==





Since the 1950s, theatrical releases have typically used
        a widescreen aspect ratio. Most TV sets use a <code class=
        "literal">4:3`` aspect ratio, so widescreen movies
        must be converted for viewing on <code class=
        "literal">4:3`` TVs. Two popular approaches to this
        conversion are described here. They are <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_and_scan" target=
        "_top">pan and scan and <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterbox" target=
        "_top">letterbox.


With pan and scan, a 4:3``
        region is shown, cutting off the left and/or right sides of
        the original picture. A human operator (sometimes the
        director) selects areas that are important to the scene,
        and tries to fit them in the <code class=
        "literal">4:3`` frame. When the action moves to a
        different part of the screen, the visible region is panned
        over to it.





**Figure&nbsp;B.4.&nbsp;Pan and scan
          version of a widescreen film**


            <img src="images/pan_and_scan.jpg" alt=
            "Pan and scan version of a widescreen film">




Throughout the 1980s, pan and scan was by far the most
        popular home video format. Pan and scan transfers make full
        use of the 4:3`` frame, so the
        viewer's TV screen is filled at all times. In the 1980s,
        VHS still ruled the home market; pan and scan makes full
        use of VHS's low (by today's standards) resolution. By
        "zooming in" on the picture, detail and picture quality are
        better preserved.


But this gain comes at a significant loss; up to half of
        the original movie picture may be cut off. Camera shots
        framed for widescreen may look amateurish and asymmetrical
        when converted to pan and scan; sometimes, important
        characters, objects, or scenery may be lost. Some directors
        forbid pan-and-scan transfers of their films.

        <div class="note" style=
        "margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">

            Note



Laserdisc was a popular niche market for movie buffs
          throughout VHS's reign; the picture quality of Laserdisc
          transfers is superior to that of VHS, but inferior to
          that of our beloved DVD.


See <a href="http://www.widescreen.org/examples.shtml"
          target="_top">Widescreen vs. Pan & Scan Examples
          for some comparisons of widescreen and pan and scan on
          actual movies.



The letterbox format, in contrast, preserves the entire
        width of the original picture. Since the original film is
        not as tall (relatively speaking) as a <code class=
        "literal">4:3`` TV set, the areas above and below the
        picture are filled with black.





**Figure&nbsp;B.5.&nbsp;Letterbox
          version of a widescreen film**


            <img src="images/letterbox.jpg" alt=
            "Letterbox version of a widescreen film">




The advantage of letterbox format is that all of the
        original picture is visible. The disadvantage is that it's
        shrunk down to fit a 4:3`` TV
        screen; a significant portion of the screen is "wasted" on
        the black bars. With VHS, a letterbox film would lose much
        of its original detail.


Since the late 1990s, pan and scan has become less
        popular. Its primary advantage to the consumer was optimal
        use of TV screen area, but the growing popularity of DVD,
        combined with the decreasing cost of <a href=
        "#HDTV">HDTV, has made it
        easier than ever to enjoy high-quality widescreen at home.
        By the early 2000s, sales of widescreen (letterbox) and
        full-screen (pan and scan) DVDs were almost equal; some TV
        series have even begun using <code class=
        "literal">16:9``.


There are several other approaches to creating
        4:3`` versions of films, but
        those typically require special filming techniques, or
        access to final proofs of the original film. For more
        information on video-transfer methods, see <a href=

              ratio==





Images and videos stored on a computer are saved as a
        big rectangle full of tiny square <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel" target=
        "_top">pixels. Each pixel stores a single color; you
        can think of a digital image as a giant paint-by-number
        grid, with millions of possible colors. The more pixels in
        a digital image, the more detail can be captured. In the
        digital camera market, this resolution is simply expressed
        in megapixels, or
        millions of pixels. A 4.0 megapixel (4 million pixel)
        camera can capture an image roughly 2,000 pixels wide and
        2,000 pixels high. It's a good thing computers are fast,
        because it would take a human a very long time to do a
        paint-by-number this big.


Digital video stored on a computer has no particular
        limitation on resolution, but digital video disc formats
        such as [VCD #VCD],
        [SVCD #SVCD], and
        [DVD #DVD] only
        allow certain resolutions, in terms of pixels. The most
        common resolution for commercial DVDs is Full-D1, which is
        720&times;480`` pixels in
        size.

        <div class="note" style=
        "margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">

            Note



Full-D1 is actually the name of two different
          resolutions, depending on whether the DVD is formatted
          for [NTSC #NTSC]
          or [PAL #PAL]
          viewers and players. PAL uses a resolution of
          720&times;576`` for Full-D1;
          NTSC uses 720&times;480``.


In addition to Full-D1, DVD supports several other
          output resolutions, including <code class=
          "literal">352&times;480`` (<code class=
          "literal">352&times;576 PAL``) and <code class=
          "literal">352&times;240`` (<code class=
          "literal">352&times;288 PAL``). Higher resolutions
          give better detail and overall quality, but fill up more
          space on the disc. These additional resolutions allow
          even single-layer DVDs to contain from 2 to 10 hours of
          video, giving DVD authors several options for balancing
          quality with quantity.



You may notice, if you try to calculate what aspect
        ratio this is, that 720 / 480 =
        1.5``, which is not a standard aspect ratio for either
        standard or widescreen TV sets. Obviously, the resolution
        of a video in pixels
        has little bearing on the aspect ratio of the video;
        1.5:1`` is the ratio of width to
        height in pixels, but nobody watches DVDs on a <code class=
        "literal">1.5:1`` TV set.


So why the weird ratio? There's a good reason for it.
        DVD was designed to perform well with both <code class=
        "literal">1.33:1`` (4:3``
        television) and 1.78:1``
        (16:9)`` widescreen). But
        instead of having two different <span class=
        "emphasis">pixel resolutions, DVD uses only
        720&times;480``. Since
        1.5:1`` is about halfway between
        1.33:1`` and <code class=
        "literal">1.78:1``, Full-D1 DVD is well-suited to
        encoding both of these common aspect ratios.


To achieve this, videos are first squished or stretched
        to fit into 720&times;480``
        pixels. Each video is marked with a bit of information
        telling the DVD player whether <code class=
        "literal">4:3`` or 16:9``
        should be used for playback. The DVD player then
        automatically does the appropriate squishing or stretching
        to restore the proportions to normal.

          encoding of 4:3 aspect ratio**


            <img src="images/4_3_dvd.jpg" alt=
            "Full-D1 encoding of 4:3 aspect ratio">




A 4:3`` picture fills the
        viewing area of a 4:3`` screen,
        but may be stretched or letterboxed when played back on a
        widescreen TV. DVDs using this format are typically
        labelled "full screen."





**Figure&nbsp;B.7.&nbsp;Full-D1
          encoding of 16:9 aspect ratio**


            <img src="images/16_9_dvd.jpg" alt=
            "Full-D1 encoding of 16:9 aspect ratio">




A 16:9`` picture is
        letterboxed when played on a <code class=
        "literal">4:3`` screen, but fills the viewing area of
        a widescreen TV. DVDs using this format are typically
        labelled "widescreen."

        <div class="note" style=

            Note



DVDs labelled "<a href=
          "#anamorphic_widescreen">anamorphic
          widescreen" or "enhanced for widescreen
          displays" use a direct 16:9``
          encoding of the widescreen picture. If a DVD is labelled
          "widescreen" (but not anamorphic), then the disc probably
          contains a 4:3`` encoding of a
          letterboxed widescreen image&ndash;and consequently,
          wastes 25% or more of its pixels on black letterbox bars.
          Anamorphic widescreen DVDs make better use of their
          available vertical resolution, and are thus superior in
          picture quality to non-anamorphic DVDs. See <a href=
          "http://www.thedigitalbits.com/editorial/bz100298.html"
          target="_top">The ABCs of Anamorphic DVD for a more
          thorough explanation.


Henceforth in this chapter, "widescreen" is synonymous
          with "anamorphic widescreen"; non-anamorphic widescreen
          is ignored completely, as if it never existed.



In these two formats, all letterboxing is done by the
        DVD player (or, in some cases, by the TV). All <code class=
        "literal">720&times;480`` pixels are used optimally,
        with none wasted on black bars. With DVD, consumers can
        choose the aspect ratio that best suits their viewing
        needs.

Television sets are not perfect. Most TVs cut off a
        small amount of the picture around the edges, due to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overscan" target=
        "_top">overscan. If there is important imagery or text
        present around the edge, it may not be visible on the
        average TV set. Directors and video producers keep
        important visual elements away from the edges by staying
        within the safe
        area.





**Figure&nbsp;B.8.&nbsp;Safe area of
          90%**


            [images/4_3_safe.jpg]




In doing video production, a good rule of thumb is to
        keep important text inside a 90% "title safe" area, and
        less important elements within a 95% "action safe" area.
        Anything outside 95% is likely to be clipped off by normal
        TV sets.

              started==





tovid began life in May 2004 as a simple one-line script
        for converting video to VCD format. I had found that it was
        not terribly easy to remember the required commands and
        command-line options for converting video from one format
        to another, and getting the output video to be compliant
        with a strict standard like VCD was not trivial.


The need to convert and encode video became more urgent
        when my wife and I purchased a DVD-RW drive. Suddenly, the
        possibility of creating our own DVDs was a reality.
        Unfortunately, it appeared to be quite difficult to find
        software that could reliably convert from one video format
        to another, particularly when the result had to strictly
        comply with a specific bitrate, frame rate, resolution, and
        encoding format. VCD, SVCD, and DVD must all be in MPEG
        format, at predetermined resolutions and bit rates. Even in
        Windows, most of the freely-available tools for video disc
        authoring had serious limitations when it came to
        converting video, if indeed they did any conversion at
        all&mdash;many authoring programs require videos to already
        be compliant with the target format.


I tried several approaches, including <a href=
        "http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">ffmpeg
        and <a href="http://zebra.fh-weingarten-de/~transcode/"
        target="_top">transcode, before settling on the use of
        mplayer and mjpegtools. While mplayer's
        mencoder** was
        not particularly well-suited to actually encoding video to
        MPEG format, mplayer is the most robust video player I know
        of for the Linux platform. It can play nearly any video you
        can throw at it, regardless of format. The utilities
        included with mjpegtools were perfect for getting MPEG
        format within the right parameters. Coupling the two
        together was fairly easy, thanks to <a href=
        "https://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=3456&group_id=5776"
        target="_top">thorough documentation. I soon had a
        working video converter, designed to take arbitrary video
        and convert it to VCD. Whenever I needed to convert to a
        different format, I just edited the script. I soon had a
        small collection of conversion scripts with names like
        todvd**,
        tovcd**, and
        tosvcd**.


The desire for additional flexibility eventually
        prompted me to write one script with a choice of output
        formats. Once I had my script into more-or-less usable
        form, I <a href=
        "http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?s=&threadid=187527"
        target="_top">posted it to LinuxQuestions.org. Soon
        after that, I was asked by a LinuxQuestions moderator if
        I'd be interested in posting the script in the <a href=
        "http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/answers.php"
        target="_top">LinuxAnswers section; <a href=
        "http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/answers/193"
        target="_top">I did, and soon received some feedback by
        other people who were using the script. With additional
        interest, I decided that it was worthwhile setting up a
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tovid/" target=
        "_top">SourceForge.net project. Interest has continued
        to grow, and there have been several official releases,
        each with new features and bugfixes based on feedback from
        other users, and from my own continued use of it.


Thanks to tremendous support and feedback from users,
        tovid is becoming a one-stop video disc authoring tool. It
        may be a while before tovid becomes the Linux equivalent of
        [Nero http://ww3.nero.com/], but
        it may very well become the <span class=
        "foreignphrase">de
        facto open-source video disc tool.

        : <a name="anamorphic_widescreen" id=
        "anamorphic_widescreen">anamorphic widescreen




An anamorphic widescreen DVD is simply one that makes
          good use of vertical resolution. Specifically, it means
          using DVD's 16:9`` aspect
          ratio for all videos having that aspect ratio or greater.
          In the context of filming, anamorphic widescreen is a
          process using special lenses to maximize the use of
          available film exposure area. For more information, see

        : DVD




Storage technology for optical discs. DVD media can be
          imprinted or recorded with any of several different
          formats. DVD-ROM is the base format, storing files in a
          UDF filesystem; DVD-Video is probably the most common
          application format, and defines how video files are
          stored on the disc and played back in a DVD player.
          DVD-Audio is another increasingly common application
          format. See the <a href=

The analog television system used in most of the
