libtovid README
tovid homepage: http://tovid.org/



What's all this, then?

This directory contains the Python source code of libtovid. libtovid provides a
Python interface to the major functionality of the tovid suite--generating
menus, encoding videos, and authoring (S)VCD and DVD discs.

As of this writing (2006-02-23), the current state of libtovid is:

    Partly working, but very incomplete

Most of the modules are in a state of flux, as the developers try to hammer out
the most logical structure. All are welcome to study and contribute to the code
(GNU GPL licensed); comments on the code's readability are also strongly
encouraged. A stated goal of the libtovid project is this:

    Source code should make sense to users

Maybe not all; programming isn't for everybody. Maybe not even most. But the
strength of open source is most fully exercised when many people get involved,
and share ideas--when those who use tovid also help to develop it.

A curious user, with minimal patience (and perhaps a Python primer) should be
able to read, and get the gist of, the Python code in this directory. If not,
it should be rewritten, improved, and simplified until it does meet this
requirement. You are invited to comment and submit patches, either via the
tovid forum:

    http://www.createphpbb.com/tovid

Or directly to the developers via the #tovid channel of irc.freenode.net.


Coding style:

The libtovid package shall, as much as possible, follow the Style Guide for
Python Code (PEP 8) and Docstring Conventions (PEP 257):

    http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0008.html
    http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0257.html

Readability is the top priority. Keep it simple. If you need further advice,
consult the following:

    $ python
    >>> import this
