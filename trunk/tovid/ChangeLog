============================================================





============================================================
Version 0.24
2005-12-20
============================================================

tovid and the GUI are back together again, along with a new
(experimental) tovid Python library, 'libtovid'.

tovidgui(.py)
* Experimental Save/Open feature added, for saving a disc project
  as a TDL text file (and loading it again later)

tovid
* Better handling of those "1000 fps" (variable framerate) input videos
* Quantization and output progress meter implemented for -ffmpeg
* Usage notes condensed
* Minor bugfixes

makemenu
* Switched to a simpler button-generation algorithm; menu highlights
  now use a "cursor" instead of highlighted text. Should eliminate
  some spumux button-related errors.
* Usage notes condensed


============================================================
Version 0.23
2005-11-14
============================================================

tovid
* Minor fixes to -fps (now accepting integers, as well as
  X:Y ratios)
* Better in/out directory handling
* -debug now prints to stdout in addition to the logfile
* Disc splitting revised (not well tested, though)

idvid
* Minor bugfixes
* AC3 is now OK for PAL DVDs

makemenu
* Default menu highlight color changed to green (#0F0)
* Tidied up code, arithmetic expressions

postproc
* Code cleanup


============================================================
Version 0.22
2005-09-17
============================================================

tovid
* Removed 'normalize' dependency by using mplayer -af volnorm.
  Normalization is now possible using -parallel.
* Aspect ratio control moved to advanced usage notes
* New -quality option added (controlling bitrate and quantization).
  Default bitrates for each format removed from script; they're now
  calculated based on default quality.
* Safe area is now rounded down to a 16-pixel multiple for (presumably)
  more efficient encoding.
* -interlaced option fixed (hopefully)

idvid
* mplayer output parsing simplified; ID_XXX= options are now executed
  directly as bash commands, instead of excessive grepping and awking.
  Many variables renamed appropriately.
* ID_LENGTH from mplayer is now used if it's nonzero, resulting in much
  faster (but possibly inaccurate) determination of video duration.
  If ID_LENGTH is zero, the old (time-consuming) approach is used.

makemenu
* Fixed backward logic in deleting/keeping temporary files (they are
  now removed UNLESS -debug is used).

makexml
* "Update scan offsets" option added to VCD output

makevcd
* Fixed vcdxbuild command-line error

============================================================
Version 0.21
2005-08-27
============================================================

previd
* New expermiental script for creating "thumbnail" video previews

tovidgui.py
* Minor tweaks to (re-)enable important functionality. Disc burning
  is now possible.
* Revamped bitrate controls (still experimental)

tovid
* -ffmpeg encoding option improved and mostly functional
* BSD-oriented and other portability enhancements
* Fixed bug causing log output to be lost
* Bugfix for re-encoding already-compliant video
* Cleaned up output

makedvd
* Mostly functional burning
* Truncate Volume ID to valid length

============================================================
Version 0.20
2005-08-14
============================================================

tovid-init 
* New script containing common suite functions and declarations

tovid
* Improved progress-meter with a new approach
* Portability enhancements and code cleanup
* Tidied up console/logfile output a bit
* Fixed (hopefully) -parallel encoding
* Temporary work directory for each tovid instance partially implemented
* -filters now actually takes comma-separated options
* Experimental -ffmpeg encoding option added (doesn't work yet)
* -fps option back in at user request, until a better solution is found

idvid
* Portability enhancements and additional output

============================================================
Version 0.19
2005-07-27
============================================================

GNU autotools now used for installation. The old tovid 'configure' script
is retired; instead, run "./configure && make install" as root to install
tovid.

tovid
IMPORTANT CHANGES
* Input filename and output filename prefix must now be specified using
  the -in and -out command-line options.
* Configuration files must now contain 'tovid' alone on the first line.
  Please edit your configuration files accordingly.
* Heavy modifications are in progress with the aim of improving portability.
  tovid now uses /bin/sh instead of bash, but it's still experimental
  and you may experience new bugs.

OTHER CHANGES
* Output and logfile formatting improved for completeness and readability
* Bugfix for panavision encoding
* Interlacing encoding (hopefully) fixed


============================================================
Version 0.18
2005-07-04
============================================================

tovid
* Able to handle input without an audio track; silence is generated instead.
* -safe option for defining a target TV safe area.
* -filters option to specify post-processing filters to be applied (or none)
* Auto aspect ratio detection and appropriate letterboxing. New -aspect option
  to override the autodetection
* Experimental -interlaced and -interlaced_bf options for creating interlaced
  output streams.
* -discsize option for breaking output files into chunks of any size. Default
  is 700 MB for (S)VCD, 4500 MB for DVD.
* Sanity check for missing audio stream.wav file.
* -subtitles option for encoding a given subtitle stream into the video.
  Currently only supports hard-encoding of subtitles; good for foreign films
  or anime, to have subs on-screen all the time.
* -update option, to print out progress reports only at specified intervals.
* Minor stream redirection, to prevent mplayer errors from showing up
  as tovid errors.
* Better stat reporting; accumulates total size of all outputs, instead of just
  the first output file.
* -fps and -twopass options removed.
* -version option
* Full URI may be used as the input file; input will be streamed over the net if
  necessary.
* -mplayeropts for passing arguments directly to mplayer
* -config option, with inclusion of a default config file. Config files contain
  valid tovid command-line options with any amount of whitespace or comments.
* Statistics log (~/.tovid/stats) now in comma-separated format for easy import,
  and now includes min/max GOP size
* Various bugfixes

tovidgui.py
* New supporting classes added for future use (HidablePanel, MiniEditorFrame)
* Bugfix to keep log window updated when GUI is not focused
* 3-step interface, instead of next/previous
* Reorganized interface classes into "task panels;" each task panel is
  responsible for completing a specific task, and will usually comprise several
  steps.
* Allowed disabling of tooltips (annoying with continued use)
* Various structural changes and bugfixes

idvid
* Identifies files that have no audio stream
* Infers aspect ratio from mplayer

makedvd, makevcd
* New scripts for imaging and burning discs. Incomplete.


============================================================
Version 0.18b
2005-02-28
============================================================

* Denoising now applied to all videos
* Slightly better error-checking

idvid
* More output, ffmpeg used if available for determining running length

makempg
* Quick-and-dirty script for converting a still image plus background
  music into an MPEG video. Useful in making menus.


============================================================
Version 0.13
2004-10-25
============================================================

tovid
* All options now require a dash '-' prefix. See usage notes.
* Added -twopass option to fix some videos with variable frame rates
* Code cleanup

tovidgui.py
* Changed options to include dash '-' when calling tovid.

idvid

  at the moment.

makexml
* Initial release. Creates a basic XML file for dvdauthor,
  defining navigation structure.


============================================================

tovid
* Added support for PAL output
* Included '%d' field in output prefix for VCD/SVCD, allowing mplex to
  split output into CD-sized chunks for large videos
* Changed '-H' mpeg2enc option to '--keep-hf' to eliminate possible
  problem with differing mpeg2enc versions
* Fixed some of the frame rate problems. Most videos should encode
  correctly now (with the exception of ASF and some MOV).
* Added (hopefully temporary) "fps" option to force a specific frame
  rate. For information on using this, please see the project website.


============================================================
Version 0.11
