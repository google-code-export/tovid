.SS Name
.P
tovid: Convert video to (S)VCD/DVD format

.SS Description
.P
tovid converts arbitrary video files into (S)VCD/DVD\-compliant
MPEG format, suitable for burning to CD/DVD\-R for playback on a
standalone DVD player.

.SS Usage
.nf
  tovid [OPTIONS] -in INFILE -out OUTPREFIX
.fi


.P
Where INFILE is any multimedia video file, and OUTPREFIX is what
you want to call the output file, minus the file extension. OPTIONS
are additional customizations, described below.

.P
By default, you will (hopefully) end up with an NTSC DVD\-compliant
MPEG\-2 video file; if you burn this file to a DVD\-R, it should be
playable on most DVD players.

.SS Examples
.TP
tovid \-in foo.avi \-out foo_encoded
Convert 'foo.avi' to NTSC DVD format, saving to 'foo_encoded.mpg'.

.TP
tovid \-pal \-vcd foo.avi \-out foo_encoded
Convert 'foo.avi' to PAL VCD format, saving to 'foo_encoded.mpg'.

.SS Basic options
.TP
\-v, \-version
Print tovid version number only

.SS Television standards
.TP
\-ntsc
NTSC format video (USA, Americas) (default)
.TP
\-ntscfilm
NTSC\-film format video
.TP
\-pal
PAL format video (Europe and others)

.SS Formats
.P
Standard formats, should be playable in most DVD players:

.TP
\-dvd
(720x480 NTSC, 720x576 PAL) DVD\-compatible output (default)
.TP

.TP
\-kdvd
(720x480 NTSC, 720x576 PAL) KDVD long\-playing DVD

.SS Advanced options
.SS Aspect ratios
.P
tovid automatically determines aspect ratio of the input video by
playing it in mplayer. If your video plays with correct aspect in
mplayer, you should not need to override the default tovid behavior.

.P
If mplayer does not play your video with correct aspect, you may
provide an explicit aspect ratio in one of several ways:

.TP
\-full
Same as \-aspect 4:3
.TP
\-wide
Same as \-aspect 16:9
.TP
\-panavision
Same as \-aspect 235:100
.TP
\-aspect WIDTH:HEIGHT
Custom aspect, where WIDTH and HEIGHT are integers.

.P
NOTE: This is the INPUT aspect ratio. tovid chooses an optimal
output aspect ratio for the selected disc format (VCD, DVD, etc.)
and does the appropriate letterboxing or anamorphic scaling.

.SS Video adjustment
.TP
\-quality NUM (EXPERIMENTAL)
Desired output quality, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10
giving the best quality at the expense of a larger
output file. Output size can vary by approximately a
factor of 4 (that is, \-quality 1 output can be 25%
the size of \-quality 10 output). Your results may vary.

At present, this option affects both output
bitrate and quantization (but may, in the future, affect
other quality/size\-related attributes). Use \-vbitrate
if you want to explicitly provide a maximium bitrate.

.TP
\-vbitrate NUM
Maximum bitrate to use for video (in kbits/sec). Must be
within allowable limits for the given format. Overrides
default values. Ignored for VCD.

.TP
\-interlaced (EXPERIMENTAL)
Do interlaced encoding of the input video. Use this option if
your video is interlaced, and you want to preserve as much
picture quality as possible. Ignored for VCD.

.TP
\-deinterlace (DEPRECATED)
Use this option if your source video is interlaced. You can
usually tell if you can see a bunch of horizontal lines when
you pause the video during playback. If you have recorded
a video from TV or your VCR, it may be interlaced. Use this
option to convert to progressive (non\-interlaced) video. This
option is DEPRECATED, and will probably be ditched in favor of
interlaced encoding, which is better in almost every way.

.TP
\-subtitles FILE
Get subtitles from FILE and encode them into the video.
WARNING: This hard\-codes the subtitles into the video, and you
cannot turn them off while viewing the video. By default, no
subtitles are loaded. If your video is already compliant with the
chosen output format, it will be re\-encoded to include the subtitles.

.TP
\-type {live|animation|bw}
Optimize video encoding for different kinds of video. Use
'live' (default) for live\-action video, use 'animation' for
cartoons or anime, and 'bw' for black\-and\-white video.
This option currently only has an effect with KVCD/KSVCD
output formats; other formats may support this in the future.

.TP
\-safe PERCENT
Fit the video within a safe area defined by PERCENT. For example,
"\-safe 90%" will scale the video to 90% of the width/height of
the output resolution, and pad the edges with a black border. Use
this if some of the picture is cut off when played on your TV.
The percent sign is optional.

.TP
\-filters {none,denoise,contrast,all} (default none)
Apply post\-processing filters to enhance the video. If your input
video is very high quality, use 'none'. If your input video is grainy,
use 'denoise'; if it looks washed out or faded, use 'contrast'. You
can use multiple filters separated by commas. To apply all filters,
use 'all'.

.TP
\-fps RATIO
Force input video to be interpreted as [NUM] frames per second.
May be necessary for some ASF, MOV, or other videos. NUM
should be an integer ratio such as "24000:1001" (23.976fps),
"30000:1001" (29.97fps), or "25:1" (25fps). This option is
temporary, and may disappear in future releases.

.SS Audio adjustment
.TP
\-normalize
Normalize the volume of the audio. Useful if the audio is too
quiet or too loud, or you want to make volume consistent for
a bunch of videos.

.TP
\-abitrate NUM
Encode audio at NUM kilobits per second.
Reasonable values include 128, 224, and 384. The default is 224 kbits/sec,
good enough for most encodings. The value must be within the allowable
range for the chosen disc format; Ignored for VCD, which must be 224.

.SS Other options
.TP
\-debug
Print extra debugging information to the log file. Useful in
diagnosing problems if they occur. This option also leaves
the log file (with a .log extension) in the directory after
encoding finishes.

.TP
\-fake
Do not actually encode; only print the commands (mplayer,
mpeg2enc etc.) that would be executed. Useful in debugging;
have tovid give you the commands, and run them manually.

.TP
\-priority {low|medium|high}
Sets the main encoding process to the given priority. With
high priority, it may take other programs longer to load
and respond. With lower priority, other programs will be
more responsive, but encoding may take 30\-40% longer.
The default is high priority.

.TP
\-discsize NUM
Sets the desired target DVD/CD\-R size to NUM MB (10^6).
Default is 700 for CD, 4500 for DVD. Use higher values at your own
risk. Use 650 or lower if you plan to burn to smaller\-capacity CDs.

.TP
\-parallel
Will perform encode/rip processes in parallel using named
pipes. Maximizes CPU utilization and minimizes disk usage.

.TP
\-update SECS
Print status updates at intervals of SECS seconds. This affects
how regularly the progress\-meter is updated. The default is once
per second

.TP
\-mplayeropts "OPTIONS"
Append OPTIONS to the mplayer command run during video encoding.
Use this if you want to add specific video filters (documented in
the mplayer manual page). Overriding some options will cause
encoding to fail, so use this with caution!

.TP
\-ffmpeg (EXPERIMENTAL)
Use ffmpeg for video encoding, instead of mplayer/mpeg2enc.
Encoding will be noticeably faster; (S)VCD and DVD are supported,
but KVCD/KDVD is not fully supported yet.

.TP
\-nofifo (EXPERIMENTAL)
Do not use a FIFO pipe for video encoding. If you are getting
"Broken pipe" errors with normal encoding, try this option.
WARNING: This uses lots of disk space (about 2 GB per minute of
video).

.TP
\-keepfiles
Keep the intermediate files after encoding. Usually, this means the
audio and video streams are kept (eg the .ac3 and .m2v files for an
NTSC DVD). This doesn't work with \-parallel because the intermediate
files are named pipes, and not real files.

.TP
\-quiet
Reduce output to the console.
