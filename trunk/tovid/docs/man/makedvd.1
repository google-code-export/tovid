.SS Name
.P
makedvd: Create and burn DVD image from dvdauthor XML input

.SS Description
.P
makedvd takes a dvdauthor XML file (as generated by 'makexml'), and authors
and optionally burns a DVD disc.

.P
To ensure that this script successfully executes, please run it from a
directory with plenty of free space. "Plenty" would be 10 GB for single\-layer
discs, and 20 GB for dual\-layer discs.  Running this program may slow down your
other applications, due to intense disk activity.

.SS Usage
.nf
  makedvd [OPTIONS] XML_INFILE
.fi

.P
For example:

.nf
  makedvd -burn MyDisc.xml
.fi


.SS Options
.TP
\-author
Author the DVD described by \fBXML_INFILE\fR. Overwrites an existing 
directory containing the dvdauthor output if already present.

.TP
\-image
Create a DVD iso image of the DVD described by \fBXML_INFILE\fR. 
Overwrites an existing ISO file if already present.

.TP
\-burn
Burn the DVD described by \fBXML_INFILE\fR. The dvd filesystem is 
automatically authored and the DVD is burned directly from that. If 
an iso image is present, or if \fB\-image\fR is specified, an image will 
be made first, and then the dvd burned from that. If not given, 
the dvd wlll be burned directly     from the authored filesystem.

.TP
\-device DEVFS_NAME (default /dev/dvd)
Burn the disc image to DEVICE, the Linux device filesystem
name of your DVD\-recorder. Common examples might be /dev/dvdrw,
/dev/scd1, and /dev/hdc. You can also use a bus/id/lun triple
such as ATAPI:0,1,0

.TP
\-speed NUM (default 1)
Burn disc at speed NUM.

.TP
\-label DISC_LABEL
Uses "DISC_LABEL" as the volume ID. This appears as the mount
name of the disc on some computer platforms. Must be <=32
alphanumeric digits without spaces.

.SS Examples
.TP
makedvd \-burn \-device /dev/dvdrw foo.xml
Author the dvd filesystem and burn to /dev/dvdrw. makedvd will
automatically call dvdauthor to make the filesystem. \fB\-author\fR
is not explicitly needed. If there's an existing filesystem, it
will be burned.

.TP
makedvd \-author foo.xml
Author the dvd filesystem and exit without burning. If the output
directory given in foo.xml already exists, then the contents are
removed before authoring. At this point, the DVD can be previewed
by calling \fIxine dvd:/path/to/output/directory\fR.

.TP
makedvd \-image foo.xml
Create an image. makedvd will automatically call dvdauthor to make
the filesystem. \fB\-author\fR is not explicitly needed. If there's 
an existing filesystem, it will be imaged with that.

.TP
makedvd \-author \-image foo.xml
Author the dvd filesystem and make an .iso image. Any existing 
filesystems or iso image files will be overwritten.
