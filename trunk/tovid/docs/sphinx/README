This directory contains tovid documentation for the Sphinx_ documentation generator.

To build HTML documentation, run::

    $ make html

from this directory.  This will create an HTML hierarchy in ``_build/html``,
including documentation on the ``libtovid`` module. An HTMl version of the
tovid manual page is also built; open ``_build/html/index.html`` to get an
index of all built documentation.

You can also build the tovid manual page via::

    $ make manpage

This builds ``_build/man/tovid.1``, which you can view with the ``man``
utility.

Run ``make`` without any arguments to see other actions.
