todisc manual


== Name ==

todisc: Create a DVD with animated menus


== Description ==

todisc is a command-line script for creating a DVD file-system with animated
thumbnail menus, from a list of multimedia video files and their titles.
It supports sub-menus for chapter breaks, configurable menu style, animated
backgrounds and transparency effects. It can automatically convert non-compliant
input files to the target format.


== Usage ==

```
 todisc [OPTIONS] \
    -files <file list> -titles <title list>
    -out OUT_PREFIX
```

For example:

```
 $ todisc -files File1.mpg File2.mpg File3.mpg \
      -titles "Episode 1" "Episode 2" "Episode 3" \
      -out Season_one
```

The number of **-files** and **-titles** must be equal. If the input files are
not mpeg, you will have the option to auto-encode them with **tovid**.

**At present there are 3 display arrangements or "templates":**

A. The default style B. showcase style   C. textmenu style

    A. No extra args needed. Thumbs will be centred, and as large as space restraints allow.

    B. -showcase IMAGE|VIDEO : will produce an arrangement with small buttons on
    the side and the showcase image/video in the centre.
    If no IMAGE or VIDEO argument is supplied, the central thumb will be omitted.

    C. -textmenu : no thumbs will be made, text will be used instead.  You can
    still make an animated menu however by using a video for the background.
    (-background VIDEO)

The **-titles** arguments should be double-quoted, with special characters
(like ", !, *, &, ?) backslash-escaped. These titles are used for labelling
thumbnails on the main menu, and for the submenu title for that video.
( see also -submenu-titles )


The -showcase and -textmenu styles can use longer titles than the default arrangement.
With -showcase style, use: "-showcase-titles-align west" to give more space for the title,
or use ""-showcase-titles-align east" to allow titles of more than one line.

The default style can only show about 16 characters (depending on the number of thumbs,
and what **-thumb-font** and **-thumb-fontsize** is being used).
If your titles are too long to fit in the label area, you may try using
sub-menus, which can display longer titles, for example:

```
 $ todisc -submenus \
          -files file1.mpg file2.mpg ... \
          -titles "Short 1" "Short 2" \
          -submenu-titles "Long Title One" "Long Title Two" \
          -out foo
```

The "-align" argument will position both titles and thumbs either south, north
east, west, southwest, northwest, southeast, northeast, subject to certain
constraints of each arrangement.

== Options ==

: -keepfiles
    Keep all intermediate/temporary files (helps with debugging)
: -dvd
    DVD-compatible output (default)
: -svcd
    Super Video-CD-compatible output: *this is currently broken for -showcase-*
: -ntsc
    720x480 output, compatible with NTSC standard (default)
: -pal
    480x576 output, compatible with PAL standard
: -submenus
    Create a sub-menu with chapters for each video (default: no sub-menus)
: -ani-submenus
    Create an animated sub-menu with chapters for each video (default: not
    animated)


== Menu style ==

: -showcase IMAGE|VIDEO (without an argument, use showcase style with no central thumb) 
    A different arrangement of images for the menu: small thumbnails go at left
    (and right) side of screen, with a larger image in the centre. Maximum of 10 videos
    If the provided argument is a video file, the central thumb will be animated.
    Pick a file of correct aspect ratio: ie. it should still look good when
    resized to 720x480 (PAL 720x576)
: -textmenu NUM ( without an argument, create a textmenu out of the supplied titles
    The optional argument specifies how many titles are in the 1st column, ie. giving
    4 titles and using "-textmenu 2" would make 2 columns of 2 titles. The default is to
    put all titles up to 13 in the first column before starting a second title.
    Maximum, 2 columns and 26 titles.
    If no video files for either -background or -showcase are supplied, the menu will be static.
: -use-makemenu
    This will call the other tovid menu script, "makemenu" on the titles supplied.
: -static
    Main menu will just be static thumbs (not animated) (default: animated)
: -background IMAGE|VIDEO
    Menu background.  This can be a image file or an video file.  If it is a
    video file the background will be animated.  Pick a file of correct aspect
    ratio: ie. it should still look good when resized to 720x480 (PAL 720x576)
: -menu-title
    Title for the root menu - may be longer than thumbnail labels
    Also if you use \n in the title, you can use multi line titles, but you
    would need to adjust -menu-fontsize to something smaller than default
    for example:

```
    $ todisc ... -menu-title "A\nMultilined\nTitle" -menu-fontsize 24
```

: -menu-font FONT
    Font to use for titles, either by ImageMagick font name (ex., "Arial") or
    explicit pathname (ex., "/full/path/to/arial.ttf"). To see a complete
    list of acceptable ImageMagick font names, run **convert -list type**, and
    refer to the leftmost column
: -menu-fontsize
    Font size for main menu - best to -preview if you use this
: -menu-fade
    Fade the menu in and out The background will fade in first, then title (and
    mist if called for), then the menu thumbs.  The fadeout is in reverse order
: -bgaudio
    An audio file for the main menu background
: -submenu-audio NUM
    List of files for sub-menu backgrounds. If one file is given, then it will
    be used for all sub-menus.  Else the number given must equal the number of
    chapters, though the keyword "none" may be used for silence


== Thumbnail style ==

: -thumb-shape [normal|oval|plectrum|egg]
    Apply a shaped transparency mask to thumbnail videos

    Display thumbnail titles in the given font
: -thumb-fontsize POINTS
    Font size to use for thumbnail titles



= ADVANCED USAGE =
== Options ==
: -debug
    Print and log additional debugging information
: -menu-length
    The desired animated main menu length in seconds
: -submenu-stroke-colo[u]r
    The colo[u]r for the sub-menu font outline (stroke)
: -submenu-title-colo[u]r
    The fill colo[u]r used for sub-menu title fonts
: -submenu-titles
    You can supple a list of titles here for sub-menus without the length
    restrictions found in thumb titles.  Must equal number of videos
: -chapters NUM
    The number of sub-menu chapters for each video (default: 6)
: -noask
    Skip all interactive questions.  No preview, no re-encoding option, no interactive
    option to use bgvideo for bgaudio.
: -tovidopts "OPTIONS"
    Pass the given string of options to 'tovid', if it is called upon to
    re-encode your non-compliant videos. Be sure to include the double-quotes
    around your list of options!


==Menu Style==

: -button-style rect|text|text-rect
    The style of button that you will see when you play the DVD.
    "rect" draws a rectangle around the thumb when you select it
    in the DVD player.  "text" highlights the thumb title text, and "text-rect"
    draws a rectangle around the title text.  "text-rect" is ONLY used for multiline
    titles in the showcase-* template.  "text-rect" is  used by default if you use -3dthumbs
    with showcase-* and multiline titles, as the others are not suitable for this arrangement.
: -rotate DEGREES
    Rotate the showcase-image|video clockwise by DEGREES.
    (default: if used without options, the rotate will be 5 degrees)
: -wave default|GEOMETRY
    Wave effect for showcase-image|video.  Alters thumbs along a sine wave using
    GEOMETRY. (default: no wave)
    "default" will produce a wave arg of -20x556, which
    produces a gentle wave with a small amount of distortion.
    See: http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~anthony/graphics/imagick6/distorts/#wave if you want
    to try other values
: -showcase-framestyle  none|glass
    For -showcase-* style template only
    "none" will use the default frame method, using "convert -frame . . ."
    "glass" will use mplayer to make frames, which gives an interesting animated
    effect to the frames, and can be much faster ( especially if you don't use -rotate or
    -wave as thumbs will not need to be processed again after mplayer spits them out
    Note: you need to be using either -showcase-image IMAGE or -showcase-video VIDEO
    for this framestyle to work.
: -title-color COLOR (or -title-colour COLOR)
    Color to use for the main menu title.  For list of supported colors do:
    **convert -list** color.  HTML notation may be used: "#ff0000". See:
    http://www.imagemagick.org/script/color.php
: -stroke-color COLOR (or -stroke-colour COLOR)
    Outline color for the main menu font. Use "none" for transparent outline
    (see title-color)
: -highlightcolor ( or -highlightcolour )
    Color to use for the menu buttons that your dvd remote uses to navigate
: -selectcolor ( or -selectcolour )
    Color to use for the menu buttons that your dvd remote uses to select
: -text-mist
    Put a semi-transparent misted background behind the title text, just
    slightly larger than the text area
: -text-mist-color COLOR (or -text-mist-colour COLOR)
    Color of the mist behind the menu text (see title-color)
: -text-mist-opacity
    Opacity of the mist behind the menu text - see -opacity
: -menu-audiolength
    The length of the background audio for a static menu.  The default is to
    use the full length of the supplied audio ( -bgaudio ).
: -submenu-audiolength
    The length of the background audio for a static submenu.  The default is to
    use the full length of the supplied audio ( -bgaudio ).
: -menu-audio-fade
    Number of sec to fade given menu audio in and out (default: 1.0 seconds)
    If you use -menu-audio-fade 0 then the audio will not be faded.
: -submenu-audio-fade
    Number of sec to fade given sub-menu audio in and out (default: 1.0 seconds)
    See -menu-audio-fade
: -intro VIDEO
   Use a introductory video that will play before the main menu.
   At present this must be a DVD compatible video at the correct resolution etc.


==Thumbnail Style==
: -opacity [0-100] (default 100)
    Opacity of thumbnail videos as a percentage (no percent sign)
    Anything less than 100(%) is semi-transparent. Not recommended with dark
    backgrounds
: -blur NUM
    The amount of feather blur to apply to the thumb-shape.  Default is 4.0 which
    will more or less keep the shape and produce transparency at the edges
    Choose float or integer values between 0.1 and 5.0
    Higher values are possible, but you may not like the result, particularly when
    using "-thumb-mist-colour none"
    3D thumbs are automatically set to a negligble blur, so this option has no effect
: -thumb-mist-colo[u]r
    Color of mist behind thumbnails
: -thumb-text-color COLOR (or -thumb-text-colour COLOR)
     Color to use for the thumb titles (see -title-color)
: -seek NUM | "NUM1 NUM2 NUM3 . . ."
     Seek to NUM seconds before generating thumbnails (default: 1.0 seconds)
     If a quoted string of values matching the number of videos is used, then
     each video can use a different seek value
: -showcase-seek NUM
     Seek to NUM seconds before generating thumbnails for showcase video
     (default: 1.0 seconds)
: -showcase-titles-align west|east (default: centre [center])
     The default is to center the text above the thumbnails.
     This option will align the titles either to the left (west) or right (east).
     Aligning west gives more space to the titles.  Aligning east also does so, and
     as well will let you use \n in your titles to achieve multi line titles.
: -tile3x1
     Use a montage tile of 3x1 instead of the usual 2x2 for 3 videos
     ie.  [movie1] [movie2] [movie3] instead of
     [movie1] [movie2]
     [movie3]
     This option only comes into play if the number of videos supplied equals 3
     Otherwise it will be silently ignored. Not used for -showcase-* style either


    ==Dvdauthor options==
: -loop
    Pause in seconds at end of menu.  Use "inf" if you wish indefinite pause.
    (Note: you can not use inf with -menu-fade as you will get a black screen
    at the end)  (default: "inf" for static menu, 10.0 seconds for animated)
: -playall
    This option will create a button on the main menu that will allow going
    right to the 1st title and playing all videos in succession before returning
    to the main menu
: -chain-videos NUM | N1-NN
    Without options this will chain all videos together so they play sequentially
    without returning to the main menu, except for the last, which will return.
    You can also specify which videos you want to behave this way by number or by
    a range.  ( ie. -chain-videos 1 2 4-6 )
: -subtitles "lang1 lang2 . . ."
    This allows selectable subtitles in the DVD, assuming you have optional subtitles
    muxed into your videos
: -audio-lang "Video1_channel Video2_channel Video3_channel . . ."
    "VideoN_channel" is the track number to use in a multitrack (multi-language) mpeg
    Usually something like -audio-lang "1 0 1"  ( 1st track is 0, 2nd is 1 . . . etc )
    If the tracks are 0. English 1.French, then the above would make
    French the audio language on Video1 and Video3, and English the audio language on Video2.
    You can check the mpeg with "mplayer -v . . ."
: -aspect 4:3|16:9 videos|menu|all  (default: all)
    This will output a <video aspect WIDTH:HEIGHT /> tag for the dvdauthor xml file.
    It will affect all videos in the titleset.  (effectively all videos since todisc only does
    one titleset)  The optional 2nd argument will apply this tag either to just the menu itself, 
    just the videos, or "all". For example:

```
    -aspect 16:9 video
```

: -widescreen nopanscan|noletterbox [nopanscan] videos|menu|all [all]
    This will output a <video widescreen=nopanscan /> tag (for example)
    for the dvdauthor xml file.  It will affect all videos in the titleset.
    Use in conjunction with -aspect if your dvd player is cropping you videos.
    example:
```
    -aspect 16:9 -widescreen
```
    The optional 2nd argument will apply this tag either to just the menu itself,
    just the videos, or "all" (both videos AND menu).  Used with a 2nd argument, "all" will
    be assumed. Used with no arguments, and "nopanscan all" will be assumed.
    Example:

```
    -widescreen nopanscan video.
```
